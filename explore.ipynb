Given an ordering on the space of revenues (payoÔ¨Äs), the classical\\naxiomatic approach of von Neumann and Morgenstern establishes the ex-\\nistence of suitable utility functions, and yields to game-theory as the most\\nprominent materialization of a theory to determine optimal behavior. Al-\\nthough this appears to be a most natural approach to risk management too,\\napplications in critical infrastructures often violate the implicit assumption of\\nactions leading to deterministic consequences. In that sense, the gameplay\\nin a critical infrastructure risk control competition is intrinsically random\\nin the sense of actions having uncertain consequences. Mathematically, this\\ntakes us to utility functions that are probability-distribution-valued, in which\\ncase we loose the canonic (in fact every possible) ordering on the space of\\npayoÔ¨Äs, and the original techniques of von Neumann and Morgenstern no\\nlonger apply.\\n\\nThis work introduces a new kind of game in which uncertainty applies\\nto the payoÔ¨Ä functions rather than the player‚Äôs actions (a setting that has\\nbeen widely studied in the literature, yielding to celebrated notions like the\\ntrembling hands equilibrium or the puriÔ¨Åcation theorem). In detail, we show\\nhow to Ô¨Åx the non-existence of a (canonic) ordering on the space of prob-\\nability distributions by only mildly restricting the full set to a subset that\\ncan be totally ordered. Our vehicle to deÔ¨Åne the ordering and establish basic\\ngame-theory is non-standard analysis and hyperreal numbers.\\n\\n‚àóUniversit¬®at Klagenfurt, Institute of Applied Informatics, System Security Group, Universit¬®atsstrasse\\n65-67, 9020 Klagenfurt, Austria.

This cycle is detailed in relevant standards\\nlike ISO 2700x, where phases designated to planning, doing, checking and acting are\\nrigorously deÔ¨Åned and respective measures are given.\\n\\nOur concern in this report is an investigation of a hidden assumption underneath\\nthis recommendation, namely the hypothesis that some wanted impact can be achieved\\nby taking the proper action.\\nIf so, then security risk management would degenerate\\nto a highly complex but nevertheless deterministic control problem, to which optimal\\nsolutions and strategies could be found (at least in theory).\\n\\nUnfortunately, however, reality is intrinsically random to some extent, and the out-\\ncome of an action is almost never fully certain. Illustrative examples relate to how public\\nopinion and trust are dependent on the public relation strategies of an institution. While\\nthere are surely ways to inÔ¨Çuence the public opinion, it will always be ultimately out\\nof one‚Äôs full and exclusive control. Regardless of this, we ought to Ô¨Ånd optimal ways\\nto inÔ¨Çuence the situation in the way we like. This can ‚Äì in theory ‚Äì again be boiled\\ndown to a (not so simple) optimization problem, however, one that works on optimizing\\npartially random outcomes. This is where things start to get nontrivial.\\n\\nDiÔ¨Éculties in the defense against threats root in the nature of relevant attacks, since\\nnot all of them are immediately observable or induce instantly noticeable or measurable\\nconsequences. Indeed, the best we can do is Ô¨Ånding an optimal protection against an a-\\npriori identiÔ¨Åed set of attack scenarios, so as to gain the assurance of security against the\\nknown list of threat scenarios. Optimizing this protection is often, but not necessarily,\\ntied to some kind of adversary modelling, in an attempt to sharpen our expectations\\nabout what may happen to us. Such adversary modeling is inevitably error prone,\\nas the motives and incentives of an attacker may deviate from our imagination to an\\narbitrary extent.\\n\\nApproaching the problem mathematically, there are two major lines of decision mak-\\ning: one works with an a-priori hypothesis of the current situation, and incorporates\\ncurrent information into an a-posteriori model that tells us how things will evolve, and\\nspeciÔ¨Åcally, which events are more likely than others, given the full information that\\nwe have. Decision making in that case means that we seek the optimal behavior so\\nas to master a speciÔ¨Åcally expected setting (described by the a-posteriori distribution).\\nThis is the Bayesian approach to decision making (see [10] for a fully comprehensive\\ndetailed). The second way of decision making explicitly avoids any hypothesis about the\\ncurrent situation, and seeks an optimal behavior against any possible setting. Unlike\\nthe Bayesian perspective, we would thus intentionally and completely ignore all available\\ndata and choose our actions to master the worst-case scenario. While this so-called min-\\nimax decision making is obviously a more pessimistic and cautious approach, it appears\\nbetter suited for risk management in situations where data is either not available, not\\ntrustworthy or inaccurate.\\n\\nFor this reason, we will hereafter pursue the minimax-approach and dedicate section\\n\\n4.2 to a discussion how this Ô¨Åts into the Bayesian framework as a special case.\\n\\n3\\n\\n\\x0cWe assume that the risk manager can repeatedly take actions and that the possible\\nactions are Ô¨Ånitely many. Furthermore, we assume that the adversary against which we\\ndo our risk control, also has a Ô¨Ånite number of possible ways to cause trouble. In terms\\nof an ISO 2700k risk management process, the risk manager‚Äôs actions would instantiate\\ncontrols, while the adversary‚Äôs actions would correspond to identiÔ¨Åed threat scenarios.\\nThe assumption of Ô¨Åniteness does stringently constrain us here, as an inÔ¨Ånite number of\\nactions to choose from may in any case overstrain a human decision-maker.\\n\\nThe crucial point in all that follows is that any action (as taken by the decision maker)\\nin any situation (action taken by the adversary) may have an intended but in any case\\nrandom outcome. To properly formalize this and Ô¨Åt it into a mathematical, in fact\\ngame-theoretic, framework, we hereafter associate the risk manager with player 1 in our\\ngame, who competes with player 2, who is the adversary. Actions of either players are\\nin game-theoretic literature referred to as pure strategies; the entirety of which will be\\nabbreviated as P S1 and P S2 for either player, so P S1 comprises all actions, hereafter\\ncalled strategies available for risk management, while P S2 comprises all trouble scenarios.\\nFor our treatment, it is not required to be speciÔ¨Åc on how the elements in both action\\nsets look like, as it is suÔ¨Écient for them to ‚Äúbe available‚Äù.\\n\\nLet P S1, P S2 denote Ô¨Ånite sets of strategies for two players, where player 1 is the\\nhonest defender (e.g., utility infrastructure provider), and player 2 is the adversary. We\\nassume player 1 to be unaware of its opponents incentives, so that an optimal strategy is\\nsought against any possible behavior within the known action space P S2 of the opponent\\n(rational or irrational, e.g., nature),.\\n\\nIn this sense, P S2 can be the set of all known possible security incidents, whose\\nparticular incarnations can become reality by the adversary‚Äôs action. To guard its assets,\\nplayer 1 can choose from a Ô¨Ånite set of actions P S1 to minimize the costs of a recovery\\nfrom any incident, or equivalently, keep its risk under control.\\n\\nUpon these assumptions, the situation can be described by an (n √ó m)-matrix of\\nscenarios, where n = |P S1| , m = |P S2|, each of which is associated with some cost\\nRij to recover the system from a malfunctioning state back to normal operation from\\nscenario (i, j) ‚àà P S1 √ó P S2. We use the variable Rij henceforth to denote the cost of a\\nrepair made necessary by an incident j ‚àà P S2 happening when the system is currently\\nin conÔ¨Åguration i ‚àà P S1.\\n\\nThe process of risk management will be associated with player 1 putting the system\\n\\ninto diÔ¨Äerent conÔ¨Ågurations over time in order to minimize the risk Rij.\\n\\nRemark 1.1 We leave the exact understanding of ‚Äúrisk‚Äù or ‚Äúdamage‚Äù intentionally\\nundeÔ¨Åned here, as this will be quite diÔ¨Äerent between various utility infrastructures or\\ngeneral Ô¨Åelds of application.\\n\\nRemark 1.2 Neither the set P S1 nor the set P S2 is here speciÔ¨Åed in any detail further\\nthan declaring it as an ‚Äúaction space‚Äù. The reason is, again, the expected diversity of\\nactions and incidents among various Ô¨Åelds of application (or utility infrastructures).\\nTherefore and to keep this report as general and not limiting the applicability of the\\nresults to follow, we will leave the precise elements of P S1, P S2 up to deÔ¨Ånitions that\\nare tailored to the intended application.\\n\\n4\\n\\n\\x0cExamples of strategies may include:\\n\\n‚Ä¢ random spot checks in the system to locate and Ô¨Åx problems (ultimately, to keep\\n\\nthe system running),\\n\\n‚Ä¢ random surveillance checks and certain locations,\\n\\n‚Ä¢ certain eÔ¨Äorts or decisions about whether or not, and which, risks or countermea-\\n\\nsures shall be communicated to the society or user community,\\n\\n‚Ä¢ etc.\\n\\nIn real life settings, it can be expected that an action (regardless of who takes it),\\nalways has some intrinsic randomness. That is, the eÔ¨Äect of a particular scenario (i, j) ‚àà\\nP S1 √óP S2 is actually a random variable Rij, having only some ‚Äúexpected‚Äù outcome that\\nmay be diÔ¨Äerent between any two occurrences of the same situation (i, j) over time.\\n\\nTo be able to properly handle the arising random variables, let us think of those\\nmodeling not the beneÔ¨Åts but rather the damage that a security incident may cause. In\\nthis view, we can go for minimization of an expectedly positive value that measures the\\ncost of a recovery. Formally, we introduce the following assumption that will greatly\\nease theoretical technicalities throughout this work, while not limiting the practicability\\ntoo much.\\n\\nThe family {Rij : i ‚àà P S1, j ‚àà P S2} of random damage distributions in our game will\\n\\nbe assumed with all members satisfying the following assumption:\\n\\nAssumption 1.3 Let Rij be a real-valued random variable. On Rij, we impose the\\nfollowing assumptions:\\n\\n‚Ä¢ Rij ‚â• 1 (w.l.o.g.1).\\n\\n‚Ä¢ Rij has a known distribution Fij with compact support (note that this implies that\\n\\nall Rij is upper-bounded).\\n\\n‚Ä¢ The probability measure induced by Fij is either discrete or continuous and has\\na density function fij. For continuous random variables, the density function is\\nassumed to be continuous.\\n\\n1.1 Symbols and Notation\\n\\nThis section is mostly intended to refresh the reader‚Äôs memory about some basic but\\nnecessary concepts from calculus and probability theory that we will use in the following\\nto develop the theoretical groundwork. This subsection can thus be safely skipped and\\nmay be consulted whenever necessary to clarify details.\\n\\n1It is common to assume losses to be ‚â• 0; our modiÔ¨Åcation has technical reasons, but causes no semantic\\ndiÔ¨Äerence in the comparisons between two loss densities, since both loss variables are just shifted by\\nthe same amount. Also, the loss can (w.l.o.g.) be scaled until losses in the range [0, 1) become\\npractically negligible.\\n\\n5\\n\\n\\x0cGeneral Symbols: Sets, random variables and probability distribution functions are\\ndenoted as upper-case letters like X or F . Matrices and vectors are denoted as bold-face\\nupper- and lower-case letters, respectively. For Ô¨Ånite sets, we write |X| for the number\\nof elements (cardinality). For real values |a| denotes the absolute value of a ‚àà R. For\\narbitrary sets, the symbol X k is the k-fold cartesian product of X; the set X ‚àû thus\\nrepresents the collection of all inÔ¨Ånite sequences (a1, a2, a3, . . .) with elements from X.\\nWe denote such a sequence as (an)n\\n\\nN.\\n\\nIf X is a random variable, then its probability distribution FX is told by the notation\\nX ‚àº FX . Whenever this is clear from the context, we omit the subscript to F and write\\nX ‚àº F only. If X lives on a discrete set, then we call X a discrete random variable.\\nOtherwise, if X takes values in some inÔ¨Ånite and uncountable set, such as R, then we\\ncall X a continuous random variable. For discrete distributions, we may also use the\\nvector p of probabilities of each event to denote the distribution of the discrete variable\\nX as X ‚àº p.\\n\\n‚àà\\n\\nCalligraphic letters denote families (sets) of sets or probability distributions, e.g.,\\nultraÔ¨Ålters (deÔ¨Åned below) are denoted as U, or the family of all probability distributions\\nbeing denoted as F. The family of subsets of a set A is written as P(A) (the power-set\\nof A). If F ‚àà F is a probability distribution, then its density ‚Äì provided it exists ‚Äì is\\ndenoted by the respective lower-case letter f .\\n\\nTopology and Norms: As our considerations in section 3 will heavily rely on concepts of\\ncontinuity and compactness or openness of sets, we brieÔ¨Çy review the necessary concepts\\nnow.\\n\\nA set A is called open, if for every x ‚àà A there is another open set B ‚äÇ A that contains\\nx. The family T of all open sets is characterized by the property of being closed under\\ninÔ¨Ånite union and Ô¨Ånite intersection. Such a set is called a topology, and the set X\\ntogether with a topology T ‚äÇ P(X) is called a topological space. An interval A is called\\nclosed, if its complement (w.r.t. the space X) is open.\\n\\nIn R, it can be shown that the open intervals are all of the form {x : a < x < b} for\\na, b ‚àà R and a < b. We denote these intervals by (a, b) and the topology on R is the set\\ncontaining all of them. Note the existence of a total ordering ‚â§ on a space always induces\\nthe so-called order-topology, whose open sets are deÔ¨Åned exactly the aforementioned way.\\nClosed intervals are denoted by square brackets, [a, b] = {x : a ‚â§ x ‚â§ b}. An set X ‚äÇ R\\nis called bounded, if there are two constants a, b < ‚àû so that all x ‚àà X satisfy a < x < b.\\nAn subset of R is called compact, if and only if it is closed and bounded.\\n\\nFor (X, dX ), (Y, dY ) being two metric spaces, we call a function f : X ‚Üí Y continuous,\\nif for every x0 ‚àà X and every Œµ > 0 there is some Œ¥ > 0 for which dX (x0, y) < Œ¥ implies\\ndY (f (x0), f (y)) < Œµ. If the condition holds with the same Œµ, Œ¥ for every x0 ‚àà A ‚äÜ X,\\nthen we call f uniformly continuous on the set A. It can be shown that if a function f\\nis continuous on a compact set A, then it is also uniformly continuous on A (in general,\\nhowever, continuity does not imply uniform continuity). In the following, we will need\\nthis result only on functions mapping compact subsets of R to probability distributions\\n(the space that we consider there will be the set of hyperreal numbers, which has a\\n\\n6\\n\\n\\x0ctopology but ‚Äì unfortunately ‚Äì neither a metric nor a norm).\\n\\n‚àû\\n\\n‚àû\\n\\nOn a space X, we write (cid:107)x(cid:107) to denote the norm of a vector x. One example is the ‚àû-\\n= max {|x1| , . . . , |xn|} for every x ‚àà Rn.\\n\\nnorm on Rn, which is (cid:107)x(cid:107)\\nThis induces the metric d\\n\\n= (cid:107)(x1, . . . , xn)(cid:107)\\n(x, y) = (cid:107)x ‚àí y(cid:107)\\n\\n‚àû\\n.\\n\\n‚àû\\nIt can be shown that every metric space is also a topological space, but the converse\\nis not true in general. However, the above deÔ¨Ånition of continuity is (on metric spaces)\\nequivalent to saying that a function f : X ‚Üí Y is continuous, if and only if every open\\n1(B) ‚àà T\\nset in Y ‚àà T\\n, when TX , TY denote the topologies\\non X and Y , respectively. This characterization works without metrics and will be used\\nlater to prove continuity of payoÔ¨Ä functions (see lemma 3.1 and proposition 3.2).\\n\\nhas an open preimage f ‚àí\\n\\nX\\n\\nY\\n\\nProbabilities and Moments: Let A ‚äÇ ‚Ñ¶ be a subset of some measurable2 space ‚Ñ¶\\nand F be a probability distribution function. The probability measure PrF (A) is the\\nLebesgue-Stieltjes integral PrF (A) = (cid:82)\\nA dF (note that this general formulation covers\\nboth, discrete and continuous random variables on the same formal ground). Whenever\\nthe distribution is obvious from the context, we will omit the subscript to the probability\\nmeasure, and simply write Pr(A) as a shorthand of PrF (A).\\n\\nAll probability distribution functions F that we consider in this report will have a\\ndensity function f associated with them.\\nIf so, then we call the closure of the set\\n{x : f (x) > 0} the support of F , denoted as supp(F ). A degenerate distribution on R\\nis one that assigns probability mass 1 to a Ô¨Ånite number (or more generally, a null-set)\\nof points in R. If Pr(A) = 1 for a singleton set A = {a} and a ‚àà R, then we call this\\ndegenerate distribution a point-mass or a Dirac-mass. We stress that such distributions\\ndo not have a density function associated with them in general3.\\n\\nMany commonly used distributions have inÔ¨Ånite support, such as the Gaussian dis-\\ntribution. The density function can, however, be cut oÔ¨Ä outside a bounded range [a, b]\\nand re-scaled to normalize to a probability distribution again. This technique lets us\\napproximate any probability distribution by one with compact support (a technique that\\nwill come handy in section 2.5).\\n\\nThe expectation of a random variable is (by the law of large numbers) the long-run\\naverage of realizations, or more rigorously, deÔ¨Åned as E(X) = (cid:82)\\n‚Ñ¶ xdF (x)dx. The k-th\\nmoment of a distribution is the expectation of X k, which we is denoted and deÔ¨Åned\\n‚Ñ¶ xkdF (x), or also E(cid:0)X k(cid:1) = (cid:82)\\nas mX (k) := E(cid:0)X k(cid:1) = (cid:82)\\n‚Ñ¶ xkf (x)dx, if F has a den-\\nsity function f . Special roles play the Ô¨Årst four moments or values derived thereof.\\nOne prominent example is the variance Var(X) = E(X ‚àí E(X))2 = E(cid:0)X 2(cid:1) ‚àí (E(X)2)\\n(this formula is known as Steiner‚Äôs theorem). Of particular importance is the so-called\\nmoment-generating function ¬µX (s) = E(exp(s ¬∑ X)), from which the k-th moment can\\nbe computed by taking the k-th order derivative evaluated at the origin, i.e., we have\\nE(cid:0)X k(cid:1) = dk\\n. Moments do not necessarily exist for all distributions (an\\n\\n(cid:12)\\n(cid:12)\\ndsk ¬µX (s)\\n(cid:12)s=0\\n\\n2We will not require any further details on measurability or œÉ-algebras in this report, so we spare details\\n\\nor an intuitive explanation of the necessary concepts here.\\n\\n3at least not within the space of normal functions; the Dirac-mass is, however, an irregular generalized\\n\\nfunction (a concept that we will not need here).\\n\\n7\\n\\n\\x0cexample is the Cauchy-distribution, for which all moments are inÔ¨Ånite), but exist for\\nall distributions with compact support (that can be used to approximate every other\\ndistribution up to arbitrary precision).\\n\\nMultivariate distributions model vector-valued random variables. Their distribu-\\ntion is denoted as FX,Y , or shorthanded as F . For an n-dimensional distribution,\\nthe respective density function is then of the form f (x1, . . . , xn), having the integral\\n(cid:82)\\nRn f (x1, . . . , xn)d(x1, . . . , xn) = 1. This joint distribution in particular models the in-\\nterplay between the (perhaps mutually dependent) random variables X1, . . . , Xn. The\\nmarginal distribution of any of the variables Xi (where 1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ n) is the unconditional\\ndistribution of Xi no matter what the other variables do. Its density function is obtained\\nby ‚Äúintegrating out‚Äù the other variables, i.e.,\\n\\nfXi(xi) =\\n\\n(cid:90)\\n\\nRn\\n\\n1\\n\\n‚àí\\n\\nf (x1, . . . , xi\\n\\n1, xi+1, . . . , xn)d(x1, . . . , xi\\n\\n‚àí\\n\\n1, xi+1, . . . , xn).\\n\\n‚àí\\n\\nA (marginal) distribution is called uniform, if its support is bounded and its density\\nis a constant. The joint probability of a multivariate event, i.e., multidimensional set\\nA w.r.t. to a multivariate distribution FX,Y , is denoted as Pr(FX,Y ) (A). That is, the\\ndistribution w.r.t. which the probabilities are taken are given in the subscript, whenever\\nthis is useful or necessary to make things clear.\\n\\nA particular important class of distributions are copulas. These are multivariate\\nprobability distribution functions on the n-dimensional hypercube [0, 1]n, for which all\\nmarginal distributions are uniform. The importance of copula functions is due to SklÀöars\\ntheorem, which tells that the joint distribution F of the random vector (X1, . . . , Xn)\\ncan be expressed in terms of marginal distribution functions and a copula function C as\\nF (x1, . . . , xn) = C(F1(x1), . . . , Fn(xn)). So, for example, independence of events can be\\nmodeled by the simple product copula C(x1, . . . , xn) = x1 ¬∑ x2 ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ xn. Many other classes\\nof copula functions and a comprehensive discussion of the topic as such can be found in\\n[8].\\n\\nConvexity and Concavity: Let V be a vector-space. We call a set A ‚äÇ V convex, if for\\nany two points x, y ‚àà A, the entire line connecting x to y is also contained in A. Let\\nf : R ‚Üí R be a function and take two values a < b. The function f is called convex, if\\nfor every two values x, y, the line between f (a) and f (b) upper-bounds f between a and\\nb. More formally, let La,b(x) be the straight line from f (a) to f (b), then f is convex if\\nf (x) ‚â§ La,b(x) for all a ‚â§ x ‚â§ b. A function f is called concave if (‚àíf ) is convex.\\n\\nHyperreal Numbers and UltraÔ¨Ålters: Take the set R‚àû of inÔ¨Ånite sequences over the\\nreal numbers R. On this set, we can deÔ¨Åne the arithmetic operations + and ¬∑ elemen-\\nN ‚àà R‚àû and b = (b1, b2, b3, . . .) =\\ntwise on two sequences a = (a1, a2, a3, . . .) = (an)n\\n‚àà\\nN ‚àà R‚àû by setting a + b = (a1 + b1, a2 + b2, a3 + b3, . . .) and a ¬∑ b = (a ¬∑ b1, a ¬∑ b2, a3 ¬∑\\n(bn)n\\n‚àà\\nb3, . . .). The ordering of the reals, however, cannot be carried over in this way, as the\\nsequences a = (1, 4, 2, . . .) and b = (2, 1, 4, . . .) would satisfy ‚â§ on some components and\\n‚â• on some others. To Ô¨Åx this, we need to be speciÔ¨Åc on which indices matter for the\\n\\n8\\n\\n\\x0ccomparison, and which do not. The resulting family of index-sets can be characterized\\nto be a so-called free ultraÔ¨Ålter, which is deÔ¨Åned as follows: a family U ‚äÜ P(N) is called\\na Ô¨Ålter, if the following three properties are satisÔ¨Åed:\\n\\n‚Ä¢ ‚àÖ /‚àà U\\n\\n‚Ä¢ closed under supersets: A ‚äÜ B and A ‚àà U implies B ‚àà U\\n\\n‚Ä¢ closed under intersection: A, B ‚àà U implies A ‚à© B ‚àà U\\n\\nIf, in addition, A /‚àà U implies that U contains the complement set of A, then U is called\\nan ultraÔ¨Ålter. A simple example of a Ô¨Ålter is the Fr¬¥echet-Ô¨Ålter, which is the family\\n{A : the complement of A is Ô¨Ånite}. A Ô¨Ålter is called free, if it contains no Ô¨Ånite sets,\\nor equivalently, if any Ô¨Ålter that contains U is equal to U, i.e., U is maximal w.r.t. the\\n‚äá-relation. An application of Zorn‚Äôs lemma to the semi-ordering induced by ‚äá shows the\\nexistence of free ultraÔ¨Ålter as being ‚äá-maximal elements, extending the Fr¬¥echet-Ô¨Ålter.\\n\\n‚àà\\n\\nN, b = (bn)n\\n‚àà\\n\\nAn ultraÔ¨Ålter naturally induces an equivalence relation on R‚àû by virtue of calling\\ntwo sequences a = (an)n\\n-equivalent, if and only if {i : ai = bi} ‚àà U,\\nN ‚â°\\nU\\ni.e., the set of indices on which a and b coincide belongs to U. The ‚â§- and ‚â•-relations\\ncan be deÔ¨Åned in exactly the same fashion. The family of equivalence classes modulo\\nU makes up the set of hyperreal numbers, i.e., ‚àóR = {[a]\\n: a ‚àà R‚àû} = R‚àû/U, where\\nU\\nb}. In lack of an exact model of ‚àóR due to the non-constructive\\n[a]\\nU\\nexistence assurance of the necessary free ultraÔ¨Ålter, unfortunately, we are unable to\\npractically do arbitrary arithmetic in ‚àóR. It will be shown (later and in part two of this\\nreport) that everything that needs to be computed practically works without U being\\nexplicitly known.\\n\\n= {b ‚àà R‚àû : a ‚â°\\nU\\n\\n‚àí\\n\\nElements of Game Theory: Let N = {1, 2, . . . , n} be a Ô¨Ånite set. Let P Si be a Ô¨Ånite\\nset of actions, and denote by P S\\ni = P S1 √ó P S2 √ó ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ √ó\\nP Si\\n\\n1 √ó P Si+1 √ó ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ √ó P Sn, i.e., the product of all P Sj excluding P Si.\\n\\ni the cartesian product P S\\n\\n‚àí\\n\\n‚àí\\n\\nA Ô¨Ånite non-cooperative n-person game is a triple (N, H, S), where the set H =\\ni ‚Üí R : i ‚àà N } contains all player‚Äôs payoÔ¨Ä functions, and the family\\n{ui : P Si √ó P S\\n‚àí\\nS = {P S1, . . . , P Sn} comprises the strategy sets of all players. The attribute Ô¨Ånite is\\ngiven to the game if and only if all P Si are Ô¨Ånite. An equilibrium strategy is an element\\nx‚àó = (x‚àó1, . . . , x‚àón) ‚àà (cid:81)n\\n\\ni=1 P Si, so that all i ‚àà N have\\n\\nui(x‚àói , x‚àó\\n‚àí\\n\\ni).\\ni) ‚â• ui(xi, x‚àó\\n‚àí\\n\\n(1)\\n\\nThat is, action x‚àói gives the maximal outcome for the i-th player, provided that all\\nother players follow their individual equilibrium strategies. Otherwise said, no player\\nhas an incentive to solely deviate from x‚àói , as this would only worsen the revenue from\\nthe gameplay4. It is easy to construct examples in which no such equilibrium strategy\\n\\n4It should be mentioned that this not necessarily rules out beneÔ¨Åts for coalitions of players upon jointly\\ndeviating from the equilibrium strategy. This, however, is subject of cooperative game-theory, which\\nwe do not discuss here any further.\\n\\n9\\n\\n\\x0cexists. To Ô¨Åx this, one usually considers repetitions of the gameplay, and deÔ¨Ånes the\\nrevenue for a player as the long-run average of all payoÔ¨Äs in each round. Technically,\\nthis assures the existence of equilibrium strategies in all Ô¨Ånite games (Nash‚Äôs theorem).\\nWe will implicitly rely on this possibility here too, while explicitly looking at the outcome\\nof the game in a single round. As this is ‚Äì by our fundamental hypotheses in this report\\n‚Äì a random variable itself, condition (1) can no longer be soundly deÔ¨Åned, as random\\nvariables are not canonically ordered. The core of this work will therefore be on Ô¨Ånding a\\nsubstitute for the ‚â•-relation, so as to properly restate (1) when random variables appear\\non both sides of the inequality.\\n\\n2 Optimal Decisions under Uncertainty\\n\\nUnder the above setting, we can collect all scenarios of actions that player 1 (defender)\\nand player 2 (attacker) may take in a tabular (matrix) fashion. Our goal in this Ô¨Årst step,\\nis to soundly deÔ¨Åne what ‚Äúa best action‚Äù would be in light of uncertain, indeed random,\\neÔ¨Äects that actions on either side cause, especially in lack of control about the other‚Äôs\\nactions. For that matter, we will consider the scenario matrix A as given below, as the\\npayoÔ¨Ä structure of some matrix-game, whose mathematical underpinning is the standard\\nsetup of game-theory (see [3] for example), with diÔ¨Äerences and necessary changes to\\nclassical theory of games, being discussed in sections 3 and later.\\n\\nLet the following tableau be a collection of all scenarios of actions taken by the defender\\n\\n(row-player) and attacker (column-player),\\n\\nA =\\n\\n\\uf8eb\\n\\n\\uf8ec\\n\\uf8ec\\n\\uf8ec\\n\\uf8ec\\n\\uf8ec\\n\\uf8ec\\n\\uf8ed\\n\\nR11\\n...\\nRi1\\n...\\nRn1\\n\\n¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ R1j\\n...\\n. . .\\n¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ Rij\\n...\\n. . .\\n¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ Rnj\\n\\n¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ R1m\\n...\\n. . .\\n¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ Rim\\n...\\n. . .\\n¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ Rnm\\n\\n\\uf8f6\\n\\n\\uf8f7\\n\\uf8f7\\n\\uf8f7\\n\\uf8f7\\n\\uf8f7\\n\\uf8f7\\n\\uf8f8\\n\\n,\\n\\nwhere the rows of the matrix A are labeled by the actions in P S1, and the columns of\\nA carry the labels of actions from P S2.\\n\\nA security strategy for player 1 is an optimal choice i‚àó of a row so that the risk,\\nexpressed by the random variable Ri‚àój is ‚Äúoptimized‚Äù over all possible actions j ‚àà P S2\\nof the opponent. Here, we run into trouble already, as there is no canonical ordering on\\nthe set of probability distributions.\\n\\nTo the end of resolving this issue, let us consider repetitions of the gameplay in which\\neach player can choose his actions repeatedly and diÔ¨Äerently, in an attempt to minimize\\nrisk (or damage). This corresponds to situations in which ‚Äúthe best‚Äù conÔ¨Åguration simply\\ndoes not exist, and we are forced to repeatedly change or reconsider the conÔ¨Åguration\\nof the system in order to remain protected.\\n\\nIn a classical game-theoretic approach, this takes us to the concept of mixed strategies,\\nwhich are discrete probability distributions over the action spaces of the players. Making\\nthis rigorous, let S(P Si) for i = 1, 2 denote the simplex over P Si, i.e., the space of all\\n\\n10\\n\\n\\x0cdiscrete probability distributions supported on P Si. More formally, given the support\\nX, the set S(X) is\\n\\n(cid:40)\\n\\nS(X) :=\\n\\n(p1, . . . , pk) ‚àà Rk : k = |X| ,\\n\\n(cid:41)\\n\\npi = 1, pi ‚â• 0 ‚àÄi\\n\\n.\\n\\nk\\n(cid:88)\\n\\ni=1\\n\\nA randomized decision is thus a rule p = (p1, . . . , pk) ‚àà S(P S) to choose from the avail-\\nable actions {1, 2, . . . , k} from the action set P S (which is P S1 or P S2 hereafter) with\\ncorresponding probabilities pi. We assume the ordering of the actions to be arbitrary\\nbut Ô¨Åxed (for obvious reasons).\\n\\nNow, we return to the problem of what eÔ¨Äect to expect when the current conÔ¨Ågu-\\nration of the system is randomly drawn from P S1, and the adversary‚Äôs action is an-\\nother random choice from P S2. For that matter, let us simplify notation by putting\\nS1 := S(P S1), S2 := S(P S2) and let the two mixed strategies be p ‚àà S1 for player 1,\\nand q ‚àà S2 for player 2.\\n\\nSince the choice from the matrix A is random, where the row is drawn with likelihoods\\nas speciÔ¨Åed by p, and the column is drawn from q, the law of total probability yields for\\nthe outcome R,\\n\\nPr(R ‚â§ r) =\\n\\nPr(Rij ‚â§ r|i, j) Pr(i, j) ,\\n\\n(2)\\n\\n(cid:88)\\n\\ni,j\\n\\nwhere Pr(Rij ‚â§ r|i, j) is the conditional probability of Rij given a particular choice (i, j),\\nand Pr(i, j) is the (unconditional) probability for this choice to occur. Section 2.1 gives\\nsome more details on how Pr(i, j) can be modeled and expressed.\\n\\nDenote by F (p, q) the distribution of the game‚Äôs outcome under strategies (p, q) ‚àà\\n\\nS1 √ó S2, then Pr(R ‚â§ r) = F (r) depends on (p, q), and (2) can be rewritten as\\n\\nPr(R ‚â§ r) = (F (p, q))(r) =\\n\\n(cid:88)\\n\\ni,j\\n\\nFij(r)Cp,q(i, j),\\n\\n(3)\\n\\nwhere Cp,q(i, j) = Pr(i, j) will be assumed as continuous in p and q for technical reasons\\nthat will become evident later (during the proof of proposition 3.2). Note that the\\ndistribution F via the function C explicitly depends on the choices p, q, and is to be\\n‚Äúoptimally shaped‚Äù w.r.t. to these two variables. The argument r ‚àà R to the function\\nF (p, q)(¬∑) is the (random) ‚Äúrevenue‚Äù, whose uncertainty is outside any of the two player‚Äôs\\ninÔ¨Çuence (besides shaping F by proper choices of p and q).\\n\\nThe ‚Äúrevenue‚Äù R in the game can be of manifold nature, such as\\n\\n‚Ä¢ Risk response of society; a quantitative measure that could rate people‚Äôs opinions\\n\\nand conÔ¨Ådence in the utility infrastructure\\n\\n‚Ä¢ Repair cost to recover from an incident‚Äôs implied damage,\\n\\n‚Ä¢ Reliability, if the game is about whether or not a particular quality of service can\\n\\nbe kept up,\\n\\n‚Ä¢ etc.\\n\\n11\\n\\n\\x0cRemark 2.1 In the simplest case of independent actions, we would set Cp,q(i, j) =\\npi ¬∑ qj when p = (p1, . . . , pn), q = (q1, . . . , qm). This choice, along with assuming Rij\\nto be constants rather than random variables, recreates the familiar matrix-game payoÔ¨Ä\\nfunctional pT Aq from (3). Hence, (3) is a Ô¨Årst generalization of matrix games to games\\nwith uncertain outcome, which for the sake of Ô¨Çexibility and generality, is ‚Äúdistribution-\\nvalued‚Äù.\\n\\nRemark 2.2 It may be in reality the case that actions of the two players are not chosen\\nindependently, for example, if both of the players possess some common knowledge or\\naccess to a common source of information.\\nIn game-theoretic terms, this would lead\\nto so-called correlated equilibria (see [3]), in which the players share two correlated\\nrandom variables that inÔ¨Çuence their choices. Things here are nevertheless diÔ¨Äerent,\\nas no bidirectional Ô¨Çow of information can be assumed like for correlated equilibria (the\\nattacker won‚Äôt inform the utility infrastructure provider about anything in advance, while\\ninformation from the provider may somehow leak out to the adversary).\\n\\n2.1 Choosing Actions (In)dependently\\n\\nThe concrete choice of the function Cp,q is only subject to continuity in p, q for tech-\\nnical reasons that will receive a closer look now. The general joint probability of the\\nscenario (i, j) w.r.t.\\nthe marginal discrete distribution vectors p, q is Prp,q {i, j} =\\nPrp,q {X = i, Y = j} = Cp,q(i, j) in (2). Under independence of the random choices\\nX ‚àº p, Y ‚àº q can be written as Pr(i, j) = Pr(X = i) Pr(Y = j) = piqj.\\n\\nNow, let us consider cases where the choices are not independent, say, if one player\\nobserves the other player‚Äôs actions and can react on them (or if both players have access\\nto common source of information).\\n\\nSklar‚Äôs theorem implies the existence of a copula-function C so that the joint distri-\\nbution F(X,Y ) can be written in terms of the copula C and the marginal distributions\\nFX , corresponding to the vector p, and FY , corresponding to the vector q,\\n\\nF(X,Y )(i, j) = Pr(X ‚â§ i, Y ‚â§ j) = C(FX (i), FY (j)).\\n\\nPr(i, j) = Pr(X = i, Y = i) = Pr(X ‚â§ i, Y ‚â§ j) ‚àí Pr(X ‚â§ i ‚àí 1, Y ‚â§ j)\\n\\n‚àí Pr(X ‚â§ i, Y ‚â§ j ‚àí 1) + Pr(X ‚â§ i ‚àí 1, Y ‚â§ j ‚àí 1)\\n\\n= C(FX (i), FY (j)) ‚àí C(FX (i ‚àí 1), FY (j))\\n\\n‚àí C(FX (i), FY (j ‚àí 1)) + C(FX (i ‚àí 1), FY (j ‚àí 1))\\n\\n= C(pi, qj) ‚àí C(pi\\n\\n1, qj) ‚àí C(pi, qj\\n\\n‚àí\\n\\n1) + C(pi\\n\\n1, qj\\n\\n1).\\n\\n‚àí\\n\\n‚àí\\n\\n‚àí\\n\\n(4)\\n\\nThus, the function Cp,q can be constructed from (4) based on the copula C (which must\\nexist). Continuity of Cp,q thus hinges on the continuity of the copula function. At least\\ntwo situations admit a choice of C that makes Cp,q continuous:\\n\\n‚Ä¢ Independence of actions: C(x, y) := x ¬∑ y\\n\\n12\\n\\n\\x0c‚Ä¢ Complete lack of knowledge about the interplay between the action choices, in\\n\\nwhich case we can set C(x, y) := min {x, y}.\\n\\nThis choice is justiÔ¨Åed upon the well-known Fr¬¥echet-HoeÔ¨Äding bound, which says\\nthat every n-dimensional copula function C satisÔ¨Åes\\n\\nC(u1, u2, . . . , un) ‚â§ min {u1, . . . , un} .\\n\\nSince the min-function is itself a copula, it can be chosen if a dependency is known\\nto exist, but with no details on the particular nature of the interplay. Observe\\nthat this corresponds to the well-known maximum-principle of system security,\\nwhere the overall system risk is determined from the maximum risk among its\\ncomponents (alternatively, you may think of a chain to be as strong as its weakest\\nelement; which corresponds to the min-function among all indicators u1, . . . , un).\\n\\n2.2 Comparing PayoÔ¨Ä Distributions\\n\\nThere appears to be no canonical way to compare payoÔ¨Ä distributions, as F (p, q) can\\nbe determined by an arbitrary number of parameters, thus introducing ambiguity in\\nhow to compare them. To see this, simply consider the set of normal distributions\\nN (¬µ, œÉ2) being determined by two parameters ¬µ and œÉ > 0. Since the pair (¬µ, œÉ) uniquely\\ndetermines the distribution function, a comparison between two members F1, F2 ‚àà N\\namounts to a criterion to compare two-dimensional vectors (¬µ, œÉ) ‚àà R √ó R+ ‚äÇ R2. It\\nis well-known that R2 is not ordered (as being isomorphic to C, on which provably no\\norder exists; see [1] for a proof), and hence there is no natural ordering on the set of\\nprobability distributions either.\\n\\nDespite this sounding like bad news, we can actually construct an alternative char-\\nacterization of probability distributions on a new space, in which the distributions of\\ninterest, in our case F (p, q) will all be members of a totally ordered subset.\\n\\nTo this end, we will rely on a characterization of a probability distribution of the\\nN of its moments. The k-th\\n\\nrandom variable R ‚àº F (p, q) via the sequence (mR(k))k\\nsuch moment is from (3) and by assumption 1.3 found to be\\n\\n‚àà\\n\\n(cid:16)\\n\\n[E\\n\\nRk(cid:17)\\n\\n](p, q) =\\n\\n(cid:90)\\n\\n‚àû\\n\\nxkdF (p, q) =\\n\\n(cid:90)\\n\\n‚àû\\n\\nxk (cid:88)\\n\\n‚àí‚àû\\n\\ni,j\\n\\nfij(x)Cp,q(i, j)dx\\n\\n‚àí‚àû\\n(cid:88)\\n\\nCp,q(i, j)\\n\\n=\\n\\ni,j\\n\\n(cid:90)\\n\\n‚àû\\n\\n‚àí‚àû\\n\\nxkfij(x)dx =\\n\\n(cid:88)\\n\\ni,j\\n\\n(cid:16)\\n\\nCp,q(i, j)E\\n\\n(cid:17)\\n\\n,\\n\\nRk\\nij\\n\\n(5)\\n\\nwhere the sum runs over i = 1, 2, . . . , n and j = 1, 2, . . . , m, and fij is the probability\\ndensity of Rij for all i, j. Notice that the boundedness condition in assumption 1.3\\nassures existence and Ô¨Åniteness of all these moments. However, assumption 1.3 yields\\neven more: since R ‚àº F (p, q) is a random variable within [0, ‚àû) (nonnegativity) and\\nhas Ô¨Ånite moments by the boundedness assumption, the distribution F (p, q) is uniquely\\ndetermined by the sequence of moments. This is made rigorous by the following lemma:\\n\\n13\\n\\n\\x0cLemma 2.3 Let two random variables X, Y have their moment generating functions\\n¬µX (s), ¬µY (s) exist within a neighborhood UŒµ(0). Assume that E(cid:0)X k(cid:1) = E(cid:0)Y k(cid:1) for all\\nk ‚àà N. Then X and Y have the same distribution.\\n\\nThe proof is merely a collection of well-known facts about moment generating functions\\nand the identity of their power-series expansions. For convenience and completeness, we\\nnevertheless give the proof in (almost) full detail.\\n\\nProof (of lemma 2.3). Let Z be a general random variable. The Ô¨Åniteness of the\\nmoment-generating function ¬µZ within some open set (‚àís0, s0) with s0 > 0 yields\\nE(cid:0)Zk(cid:1) = ¬µ(k)\\nz (0) via the k-th order derivative of ¬µZ [2, Theorem 3.4.3]. Furthermore,\\nif the moment generating function exists within (‚àís0, s0), then it has a Taylor-series\\nexpansion (cf. [5, Sec.11.6.1]).\\n\\n¬µZ(s) =\\n\\n¬µ(k)\\nZ (0)\\nk!\\n\\nsk,\\n\\n‚àû(cid:88)\\n\\nk=0\\n\\n‚àÄs ‚àà (‚àís0, s0).\\n\\n(6)\\n\\nIdentity of moments between X and Y (the lemma‚Äôs hypothesis) thus implies the iden-\\ntity of the Taylor-series expansions of ¬µX and ¬µY and in turn the identity ¬µX (s) = ¬µY (s)\\non (‚àís0, s0). This equation Ô¨Ånally implies that X and Y have the same distribution by\\n(cid:3)\\nthe uniqueness theorem of moment-generating functions [2, Theorem 3.4.6].\\n\\nLemma 2.3 is the permission to characterize random variables only by their moment-\\nsequence to uniquely pin-down the probability distribution, i.e., we will hereafter write\\nmR(k) := E(cid:0)Rk(cid:1), and use\\n\\n(mR(k))k\\n\\nN,\\n\\n‚àà\\n\\nto represent the random variable R ‚àº F (p, q).\\n\\n(7)\\n\\nLet R‚àû denote the set of all sequences, on which we deÔ¨Åne a partial ordering by\\nvirtue of the above characterization as follows:\\nlet F1 = F (p1, q1), F2 = F (p2, q2) be\\ntwo distributions deÔ¨Åned by (3). As a Ô¨Årst try, we could deÔ¨Åne a preference relation\\nbetween two distributions F1, F2 by comparing their moment sequences element-wise,\\ni.e., we would prefer F1 over F2 if the respective moments satisfy mR1(k) ‚â§ mR2(k) for\\nall k whenever R1 ‚àº F1 and R2 ‚àº F2.\\n\\nIt must be stressed that without extra conditions, this ordering is at most a partial one,\\nsince we could allow inÔ¨Ånitely alternating values for the moments in both sequences. To\\nmake the ordering total, we have to be speciÔ¨Åc on which indices matter and which don‚Äôt.\\nThe result will be a standard ultrapower construction, so let U denote an arbitrary\\nultraÔ¨Ålter. Fortunately, the preference ordering by comparing moments elementwise\\nis ultimately independent of the particular ultraÔ¨Ålter in use. This is made precise in\\ntheorem 2.5 that is implied by a simple analysis of continuous distributions. We treat\\nthese Ô¨Årst and discuss the discrete case later, as all of our upcoming Ô¨Åndings remain\\nvalid under the discrete setting.\\n\\nThe Continuous Case:\\n\\n14\\n\\n\\x0cLemma 2.4 For any two probability distributions F1, F2 and associated random vari-\\nables R1 ‚àº F1, R2 ‚àº F2 that satisfy assumption 1.3 on the compact set ‚Ñ¶ (covering both\\nsupports) and in the continuous case, assume that f1(a) (cid:54)= f2(a) at a = max ‚Ñ¶. Then,\\nthere is a K ‚àà N so that either [‚àÄk ‚â• K : mR1(k) ‚â§ mR2(k)] or [‚àÄk ‚â• K : mR1(k) ‚â•\\nmR2(k)].\\nProof. Let f1, f2 denote the densities of the distributions F1, F2. Fix the smallest b‚àó > 1\\nso that ‚Ñ¶ := [1, b‚àó] covers both the supports of F1 and F2. Consider the diÔ¨Äerence of\\nthe k-th moments, given by\\n\\n‚àÜ(k) := E\\n\\n(cid:17)\\n\\n(cid:16)\\n\\nRk\\n1\\n\\n(cid:16)\\n\\n‚àí E\\n\\n(cid:17)\\n\\nRk\\n2\\n\\n=\\n\\n=\\n\\n(cid:90)\\n\\n‚Ñ¶\\n\\n(cid:90)\\n\\n‚Ñ¶\\n\\nxkf1(x)dx ‚àí\\n\\n(cid:90)\\n\\n‚Ñ¶\\n\\nxkf2(x)dx\\n\\nxk(f1 ‚àí f2)(x)dx.\\n\\n(8)\\n\\nTowards a lower bound to (8), we distinguish two cases:\\n\\n1. If f1(x) > f2(x) for all x ‚àà ‚Ñ¶, then (f1 ‚àí f2)(x) > 0 and because f1, f2 are\\ncontinuous, their diÔ¨Äerence attains a minimum Œª2 > 0 on the compact set ‚Ñ¶. So,\\nwe can lower-bound (8) as ‚àÜ(k) ‚â• Œª2\\n\\n(cid:82)\\n‚Ñ¶ xkdx ‚Üí +‚àû, as k ‚Üí ‚àû.\\n2. Otherwise, we look at the right end of the interval ‚Ñ¶, and deÔ¨Åne\\n\\na‚àó := inf {x ‚â• 1 : f1(x) > f2(x)} .\\n\\nWithout loss of generality, we may assume a‚àó < b‚àó. To see this, note that if\\nf1(b‚àó) (cid:54)= f2(b‚àó), then the continuity of f1 ‚àí f2 implies f1(x) (cid:54)= f2(x) within a range\\n(b‚àó ‚àí Œµ, b‚àó] for some Œµ > 0, and a‚àó is the supremum of all these Œµ. Otherwise,\\nif f1(x) = f2(x) on an entire interval [b‚àó ‚àí Œµ, b‚àó] for some Œµ > 0, then f1 (cid:54)> f2\\non ‚Ñ¶ (the opposite of the previous case) implies the existence of some Œæ < b‚àó so\\nthat f1(x) < f2(x), and a‚àó is the supremum of all these Œæ (see Ô¨Ågure 1 for an\\nillustration). In case that Œæ = 0, we would have f1 ‚â• f2 on ‚Ñ¶, which is either\\ntrivial (as ‚àÜ(k) = 0 for all k if f1 = f2) or otherwise covered by the previous case.\\nIn either situation, we can Ô¨Åx a compact interval [a, b] ‚äÇ (a‚àó, b‚àó) ‚äÇ [1, b‚àó] = ‚Ñ¶\\nand two constants Œª1, Œª2 > 0 (which exist because f1, f2 are bounded as being\\ncontinuous on the compact set ‚Ñ¶), so that the function\\n\\n(cid:96)(k, x) :=\\n\\n(cid:26) ‚àíŒª1xk,\\nŒª2xk,\\n\\nif 1 ‚â§ x < a;\\nif a ‚â§ x ‚â§ b.\\n\\nlower-bounds the diÔ¨Äerence of densities in (8) (see Ô¨Ågure 1), and\\n\\n‚àÜ(k) =\\n\\n(cid:90) b‚àó\\n\\n1\\n\\nxk(f1 ‚àí f2)(x)dx ‚â•\\n\\n(cid:90) b\\n\\n1\\n\\n(cid:96)(x, k)dx\\n\\n(cid:90) a\\n\\n= ‚àíŒª1\\n\\nxkdx + Œª2\\n\\n(cid:90) b\\n\\na\\n\\nxkdx\\n\\nbk+1\\nk + 1\\n\\n‚Üí +‚àû,\\n\\n(Œª1 + Œª2) + Œª2\\n\\n1\\nak+1\\nk + 1\\n\\n= ‚àí\\n\\n15\\n\\n\\x0cFigure 1: Lower-bounding the diÔ¨Äerence of densities\\n\\nas k ‚Üí ‚àû due to a < b and because Œª1, Œª2 are constants that depend only on f1, f2.\\nIn both cases, we conclude that, unless f1 = f2, ‚àÜ(k) > 0 for suÔ¨Éciently large\\nk ‚â• K where K is Ô¨Ånite.\\n\\n(cid:3)\\n\\nTheorem 2.5 Let F be the set of distributions that satisfy assumption 1.3. Assume\\nthe elements of F to be represented by hyperreal numbers in R‚àû/U, where U is any free\\nultraÔ¨Ålter. There exists a total ordering on a dense subset of F that is independent of U.\\n\\nProof. Let F1, F2 be two probability distributions, and let R1 ‚àº F1, R2 ‚àº F2. Let ‚Ñ¶\\nbe the union of both supports of R1, R2, and put a = max ‚Ñ¶. If f1(a) = f2(a), then\\nwe can truncate the support and the densities f1, f2 by some (small) Œµ > 0 such that\\nf1(a‚àíŒµ) (cid:54)= f2(a‚àíŒµ). If no such Œµ would exist, the two densities are identical and we have\\nequivalence. Otherwise, by continuity, we can choose Œµ arbitrarily small to approximate\\nF1 and F2 to any desired precision, thus picking an element of a dense subset of F on\\nwhich the conditions of Lemma 2.4 hold. Call them F1, F2 again to ease our notation.\\nLemma 2.4 assures the existence of some K ‚àà N so that F1 (cid:22) F2 by mR1(k) ‚â§ mR2(k)\\nwhenever k ‚â• K. Let L be the set of indices where mR1(k) ‚â§ mR2(k), then complement\\nset N\\\\L is Ô¨Ånite (it has at most K ‚àí1 elements). Let U be an arbitrary ultraÔ¨Ålter. Since\\nN \\\\ L is Ô¨Ånite, it cannot be contained in U as U is free. And since U is an ultraÔ¨Ålter, it\\nmust contain the complement a set, unless it contains the set itself. Hence, L ‚àà U, and\\n(cid:3)\\nthe claim follows. The converse case is treated analogously.\\n\\nRemark 2.6 If two distributions alternate inÔ¨Ånitely often within a compact interval,\\nthen the two would not compare by their tail masses as Lemma 2.4, without the hypoth-\\nesis f1(a) (cid:54)= f2(a). Examples are constructible by ‚Äúsqueezing‚Äù alternating densities (cf.\\nExample 2.11) into a compact range. However, the assumption made by Lemma 2.4 is\\nnonetheless mild, since we can Ô¨Ånd truncations to make the distribution satisfy the con-\\nditions, and choose the truncation to approximate the given densities up to any precision\\n\\n16\\n\\nf1f2a‚àóabb‚àóŒª1f1‚àíf2Œª20Œæ‚Ñì(k,x)\\x0cthat we desire. This argument extends to the order relation even to approximations of\\ndistributions with unbounded support.\\n\\nNow, we can state our preference criterion on distributions on the quotient space F ‚äÇ\\nR‚àû/U, in which each probability distribution of interest is represented by its sequence of\\nmoments. Thanks to theorem 2.5, there is no need to construct the ultraÔ¨Ålter U in order\\nto well-deÔ¨Åne best responses, since two distributions will compare in the same fashion\\nunder any admissible choice of U.\\n\\nDeÔ¨Ånition 2.7 (Preference Relation over Probability Distributions) Let R1, R2\\nbe two random variables whose distributions F1, F2 satisfy assumption 1.3. We prefer\\nF1 over F2 relative to an ultraÔ¨Ålter U, written as\\n\\nF1 (cid:22) F2 : ‚áê‚áí ‚àÉK ‚àà N s.t. ‚àÄk ‚â• K : mR1(k) ‚â§ mR2(k)\\n\\n(9)\\n\\nStrict preference of F1 over F2 is denoted as\\n\\nF1 ‚â∫ F2 : ‚áê‚áí ‚àÉK ‚àà N s.t. ‚àÄk ‚â• K : mR1(k) < mR2(k)\\n\\nTheorem 2.5 establishes this deÔ¨Ånition to be compatible with (in the sense of being\\na continuation of) the ordering on the hyperreals R‚àû/U, being deÔ¨Åned as a ‚â§ b iÔ¨Ä\\n{i : ai ‚â§ bi} ‚àà U, when a, b are represented by sequences (ai)i\\nN. The more\\ngeneral version of DeÔ¨Ånition 2.7 would thus put two random variables X, Y into order\\nX (cid:22) Y if and only if their representative moment-sequences satisfy (E(X k))k\\nN ‚â§\\n(E(Y k))k\\nN when treated as hyperreal numbers. The above results restrict the ordering\\nrelation to a dense subset of F, but have the appeal of a nicer interpretation (Theorem\\n2.15) and algorithmic decidability.\\n\\nN, (bi)i\\n\\n‚àà\\n\\n‚àà\\n\\n‚àà\\n\\n‚àà\\n\\nBy virtue of the (cid:22)-relation, we can deÔ¨Åne an equivalence ‚â° between two distributions\\n\\nin the canonical way as\\n\\nF1 ‚â° F2 : ‚áê‚áí (F1 (cid:22) F2) ‚àß (F2 (cid:22) F1).\\n\\n(10)\\n\\nWithin the quotient space F ‚äÇ R‚àû/U, we thus consider two distributions as identical,\\nif only a Ô¨Ånite set of moments between them mismatch. Observe that this does not imply\\nthe identity of the distribution functions themselves, unless actually all moments match.\\nThe strict preference relation ‚â∫ induces an ordering topology T on F, whose open sets\\n\\nare for any two distributions F1, F2,\\n\\n(F1, F2) := {F ‚àà F : F1 ‚â∫ F ‚â∫ F2} ,\\n\\nand the topology is denoted as T = {(F1, F2)|F1, F2 ‚àà F where F1 ‚â∫ F2}.\\n\\nIn situations where the game‚Äôs payoÔ¨Äs are better modeled by\\nThe Discrete Case:\\ndiscrete random variables, say if a nominal scale (‚Äúlow‚Äù, ‚Äúmedium‚Äù, ‚Äúhigh‚Äù) or a scoring\\nscheme is used to express revenue, assumption 1.3 is too strong in the sense of prescribing\\na continuous density where the model density is actually discrete.\\n\\n17\\n\\n\\x0cAssumption 1.3 covers discrete distributions that possess a density w.r.t. the counting\\nmeasure. The line of arguments as used in the proof of Lemma 2.4 remains intact without\\nchange, except for the obvious diÔ¨Äerence that ‚Ñ¶ is a Ô¨Ånite (and hence discrete) set now.\\nLikewise, all conclusions drawn from lemma 2.4, including theorem 2.5, as well as the\\ndeÔ¨Ånitions of ordering and topology transfer without change.\\n\\n2.3 Comparing Discrete and Continuous Distributions\\n\\nThe representation (7) of distributions by the sequence of their moments works even\\nwithout assuming the density to be continuous. Therefore, it elegantly lets us compare\\ndistributions of mixed type, i.e., continuous vs. discrete distributions on a common\\nbasis.\\n\\nIt follows that we can ‚Äì without any changes to the framework ‚Äì compare discrete\\nto continuous distributions, or any two distributions of the same type in terms of the\\n(cid:22)-, ‚â∫- and ‚â°-relations. This comparison is, obviously, only meaningful if the respective\\nrandom variables live in the same (metric) space. For example, it would be meaningless\\nto compare ordinal to numeric data.\\n\\n2.4 Comparing Deterministic to Random\\n\\nIn certain occasions, the consequence of an action may result in perfectly foreseeable ef-\\nfects, such as Ô¨Ånes or similar. Such deterministic outcomes can be modeled as degenerate\\ndistributions (point- or Dirac-masses)5. These are singular and thus violate assumption\\n1.3, since there is no density function associated with them, unless one is willing to resort\\nto generalized functions; which we do not do in this report. Nevertheless, it is possible\\nto work out the representation in terms of moment sequences. If X is a random variable\\nthat deterministically takes on the constant value a all the time, then the respective\\nmoment sequence has elements E(cid:0)X k(cid:1) = E(cid:0)ak(cid:1) = ak for all k ‚àà N. Given another\\nnon-degenerate distribution with density function f , supported on ‚Ñ¶ = [0, b], we can\\nlower- or upper-bound the moments of the respective random variable Y by exponential\\nfunctions in k, which can straightforwardly (cid:22)-, ‚â°- or ‚â∫-compared to the representative\\nN of the (deterministic) outcome a ‚àà R. Algorithmic details will follow in part\\n(ak)k\\ntwo of this research report.\\n\\n‚àà\\n\\n2.5 Extensions: Relaxing Assumption 1.3\\n\\nRisk management is often required to handle or avoid extreme (catastrophic) events.\\nThe respective statistical models are distributions with so-called ‚Äúheavy‚Äù, ‚Äúlong‚Äù or\\n‚Äúfat‚Äù tails (exact deÔ¨Ånitions and distribution models will follow in part two of this re-\\nport). Extreme-value distributions such as the Gumbel-distribution, or also the Cauchy-\\ndistribution (that is not an extreme value model) are two natural examples that fall into\\n\\n5Note that the canonic embedding of the reals within the hyperreals represents a number a ‚àà R by the\\nconstant sequence (a, a, . . .). Picking up this idea would be critically Ô¨Çawed in our setting, as any\\nsuch constant sequence would be preferred over any probability distribution (whose moment sequence\\ndiverges and thus overshoots a inevitably and ultimately).\\n\\n18\\n\\n\\x0cthe class of distributions that assign unusually high likelihood to large outcomes (that\\nmay be considered as catastrophic consequences of an action). In any case, our assump-\\ntion 1.3 rules out such distributions by requiring compact support. Even worse, the\\n‚â∫-relation based on the representation of a distribution by the sequence of its moments\\ncannot be extended to cover distributions with heavy tails, as those typically do not\\nhave Ô¨Ånite moments or moment-generating functions. Nevertheless, such distributions\\nare important tools in risk management.\\n\\nThings are, however, not drastically restricted by assumption 1.3, for at least two\\nreasons: First, compactness of the support is not necessary for all moments to exist,\\nas the Gaussian distribution has moments of all orders and is supported on the entire\\nreal line (thus violating even two of the three conditions of assumption 1.3). Still, it\\nis characterized entirely by its Ô¨Årst two moments, and thus can easily be compared in\\nterms of the ‚â∫-relation.\\n\\nSecond, and more importantly, any distribution with inÔ¨Ånite support can be approxi-\\nmated by a truncated distribution. Given a random variable X with distribution function\\nF , then the truncated distribution is the distribution of X conditional on X falling into\\na Ô¨Ånite range, i.e., the truncated distribution function ÀÜF gives the conditional likelihood\\n\\nÀÜF (x) = Pr(X ‚â§ x|a ‚â§ X ‚â§ b).\\n\\nProvided that F has a density function f , the truncated density function is\\n\\n(cid:40)\\n\\nÀÜf (x) =\\n\\nf (x)\\n\\nF (a) , a ‚â§ x ‚â§ b;\\n‚àí\\notherwise.\\n\\nF (b)\\n0,\\n\\nIn other words, we simply crop the density f outside the interval [a, b] and re-scale the\\nresulting function to become a probability distribution again.\\n\\nSince every distribution function F is non-decreasing and satisÔ¨Åes limx\\n\\nF (x) = 1,\\nany choice of Œ¥ > 0 admits a value b such that F (b) > 1 ‚àí Œ¥. Moreover, since our random\\n(cid:82) x\\nvariables are all non-negative, we have limx\\n0 f (x)dx = 0, since\\nF is right-continuous. It follows that the truncated distribution density for variables of\\ninterest in our setting simpliÔ¨Åes to ÀÜf (x) = f (x)/F (b). Now, let us compare a distribution\\nF to its truncated version ÀÜF in terms of the probabilities that we would compute:\\n\\n0+ F (x) = limx\\n\\n‚Üí ‚àû\\n\\n0+\\n\\n‚Üí\\n\\n‚Üí\\n\\n(cid:12)\\n(cid:12)\\n(cid:12)F (x) ‚àí ÀÜF (x)\\n(cid:12)\\n(cid:12)\\n(cid:12) =\\n\\n(cid:12)\\n(cid:90) x\\n(cid:12)\\n(cid:12)\\n(cid:12)\\n= (cid:12)\\n(cid:12)\\n\\n0\\n(cid:90) x\\n\\n0\\n\\nf (t)dt ‚àí\\n\\nf (t)\\n\\n(cid:18)\\n\\n(cid:124)\\n\\n(cid:90) x\\n\\n0\\n\\n(cid:12)\\n(cid:12)\\nf (t)/F (b)dt\\n(cid:12)\\n(cid:12)\\n(cid:90)\\n\\n(cid:19)\\n\\ndt(cid:12)\\n\\n(cid:12) < Œµ\\n\\n1 ‚àí\\n\\n1\\nF (b)\\n(cid:123)(cid:122)\\n<Œµ\\n\\n(cid:125)\\n\\n0\\n\\n‚àû\\n\\nf (t)dt = Œµ,\\n\\nfor suÔ¨Éciently large b, which depends on the chosen Œµ > 0 that determines the quality\\nof approximation. Conversely, can Ô¨Ånd always Ô¨Ånd a truncated distribution ÀÜF that\\napproximates F up to an arbitrary precision Œµ > 0. This shows that restricting ourselves\\nto distributions with compact support, i.e., adopting assumption 1.3, causes no more\\nthan a numerical error that can be made as small as we wish.\\n\\n19\\n\\n\\x0cMore interestingly, we could attempt to play the same trick as before, and character-\\nize a distribution with fat, heavy or long tails by a sequence of approximations to it,\\narising from better and better precisions Œµ ‚Üí 0. In that sense, we could hope to compare\\napproximations rather than the true density in an attempt to extend the preference and\\nequivalence relations (cid:22) and ‚â° to distributions with fat, heavy or long tails.\\n\\nUnfortunately, such hope is wrong, as a distribution is not uniquely characterized\\nby a general sequence of approximations (i.e., we cannot formulate an equivalent to\\nlemma 2.3), and the outcome of a comparison of approximations is not invariant to\\nhow the approximations are chosen (i.e., there is also no alike for lemma 2.4). To see\\n1(Œ±) for a distribution F , and consider the\\nthe latter, take the quantile function F ‚àí\\n1(Œ±) = F ‚àí\\ntail quantiles F ‚àí\\nwith Œ±n ‚Üí 0. Since\\n1(Œ±n) ‚Üí ‚àû, where the limit\\nlimx\\nis independent of the particular sequence (Œ±n)n\\n, but only the speed of divergence is\\ndiÔ¨Äerent for distinct sequences.\\n\\nF (x) = 1, the tail quantile sequence behaves like F ‚àí\\n\\n1(1 ‚àí Œ±). Pick any sequence (Œ±n)n\\n\\n‚Üí ‚àû\\n\\n‚Üí ‚àû\\n\\n‚Üí ‚àû\\n\\nNow, let two distributions F1, F2 with inÔ¨Ånite support be given. Fix two sequences\\n\\nŒ±n and œân, both vanishing as n ‚Üí ‚àû, and set\\n\\n1\\n1\\nan := F ‚àí\\n2 (œân).\\n1 (Œ±n) ‚â§ bn := F ‚àí\\n(11)\\nLet us approximate F1 by a sequences of truncated distributions ÀÜf1,n with supports\\n[0, an] and let the sequence ÀÜf2,n approximate f2 on [0, bn]. Since an ‚â§ bn for all n, the\\nproof of lemma 2.4 then implies that the approximations with support [0, an] is always\\nstrictly preferable to the distribution with support [0, bn], thus ÀÜf1,n (cid:22) ÀÜf2,n. However,\\nby replacing the ‚Äú‚â§‚Äù by a ‚Äú‚â•‚Äù in (11), we can construct approximations to F1, F2\\nwhose supports exceed one another in the reverse way, so that the approximations would\\nalways satisfy ÀÜf1,n (cid:23) ÀÜf2,n. It follows that the sequence of approximations cannot be used\\nto unambiguously compare distributions with inÔ¨Ånite support, unless we impose some\\nconstraints on the tails of the distributions and the approximations. The next lemma\\nassumes this situation to simply not occur, which allows to give a suÔ¨Écient condition\\nto unambiguously extend strict preference in the way we wish.\\n\\nLemma 2.8 Let F1, F2 be two distributions supported on the entire nonnegative real\\nhalf-line R+ with continuous densities f1, f2.

Throughout the proof, let i ‚àà {1, 2}. The truncated distribution density that\\napproximates fi is fi(x)/(Fi(an) ‚àí Fi(0)), where [0, an] is the common support of n-th\\napproximation to f1, f2. By construction, an,i ‚Üí ‚àû as n ‚Üí ‚àû, and therefore Fi(an) ‚àí\\nFi(0) ‚Üí 1 for i = 1, 2.

The last inequality (12) lets us compare the two approxi-\\nmations easily by the same arguments as have been used in the proof of lemma 2.4, and\\n(cid:3)\\nthe claim follows.\\n\\nBy virtue of lemma 2.8, we can extend the strict preference relation to distributions\\nthat satisfy the hypothesis of the lemma but need not have compact support anymore.\\nPrecisely, we would strictly prefer one distribution over the other, if all truncated ap-\\nproximations are ultimately preferable over one another.\\n\\nDeÔ¨Ånition 2.9 (Extended Preference Relation ‚â∫) Let F1, F2 be distribution func-\\ntions of nonnegative random variables that have inÔ¨Ånite support and continuous density\\nfunctions f1, f2. We (strictly) prefer F1 over F2, denoted as F1 ‚â∫ F2, if for every se-\\nquence an ‚Üí ‚àû there is an index N so that the approximations ÀÜFi,n for i = 1, 2 satisfy\\nÀÜF1,n ‚â∫ ÀÜF2,n whenever n ‚â• N .\\n\\nThe (cid:31)-relation is deÔ¨Åned alike, i.e., the ultimate preference of F2 over F1 on any\\n\\nsequence of approximations.\\n\\nDeÔ¨Ånition 2.9 is motivated by the above arguments on comparability on common\\nsupports, and lemma 2.8 provides us with a handy criterion to decide the extended\\nstrict preference relation.\\n\\nExample 2.10 It is a simple matter to verify that any two out of the three kinds of\\nextreme value distributions (Gumbel, Frechet, Weibull) satisfy the above condition, thus\\nare strictly preferable over one another, depending on their particular parametrization.\\n\\nDeÔ¨Ånition 2.9 can, however, not applied to every pair of distributions, as the following\\n\\nexample shows.\\n\\nExample 2.11 Take the ‚ÄúPoisson-like‚Äù distributions with parameter Œª > 0,\\n\\nf1(k) ‚àù\\n\\n(cid:40) Œªk/2\\n\\n(k/2)! e‚àí\\n0,\\n\\nŒª, when k is even;\\notherwise.\\n\\n(cid:40)\\n\\n,\\n\\nf2(k) ‚àù\\n\\n0,\\nŒª(k\\n((k\\n\\n1)/2\\n\\n‚àí\\n\\n1)/2)! e‚àí\\n‚àí\\n\\nwhen k is even;\\n\\nŒª, otherwise\\n\\nIt is a simple matter to verify that no constant c < 1 can ever make f1 < c ¬∑ f2 and\\nthat all moments exist. However, neither distribution is preferable over the other, since\\nÔ¨Ånite approximations based on the sequence an := n will yield alternatingly preferable\\napproximations.\\n\\n21\\n\\n\\x0cAn occasionally simpler condition that implies the hypothesis of deÔ¨Ånition 2.9 is\\n\\nf1(x)\\nf2(x)\\n\\nlim\\nx\\n‚Üí ‚àû\\n\\n= 0.\\n\\n(13)\\n\\nThe reason is simple: if the condition of deÔ¨Ånition 2.9 were violated, then there is an in-\\nN for which f1(xn) ‚â• c ¬∑ f2(xn) for all c < 1.

Letting c ‚Üí 1, we can con-\\nN for which limk\\nsubsequence (xnk )k\\n‚àà\\nstruct a further subsequence of (xnk )k\\n(f1(xn)/f2(xn)) =\\nN to exhibit that lim supn\\n‚àà\\n1, so that condition (13) would be refuted.\\n\\n‚Üí ‚àû\\n\\n‚Üí ‚àû\\n\\nRemark 2.12 It must be emphasized that the above line of arguments does not provide\\nus with a mean to extend the (cid:22)- or ‚â°-relations accordingly. For example, an attempt to\\ndeÔ¨Åne (cid:22) and ‚â° as above is obviously doomed to failure, as asking for two densities f1, f2\\nto satisfy f1(x) ‚â§ c1 ¬∑ f2(x) ultimately (note the intentional relaxation of < towards ‚â§),\\nand f2(x) ‚â§ c2 ¬∑ f1(x) ultimately for two constants c1, c2 < 1 is nonsense.\\n\\nA straightforward extension of (cid:22) can be derived from (based on) the conclusion of\\n\\nlemma 2.8:\\n\\nDeÔ¨Ånition 2.13 Let F1, F2 be two distributions supported on the entire nonnegative\\nreal half-line R+ with continuous densities f1, f2. Let (an)n\\nN be a diverging sequence\\n‚àà\\ntowards ‚àû, and let ÀÜFi,n for i = 1, 2 denote the density Fi truncated to have support\\n[0, an]. We deÔ¨Åne F1 (cid:22) F2 if and only if for every sequence (an)n\\nN there is some index\\n‚àà\\nN so that ÀÜF1,n (cid:22) ÀÜF2,n for every n ‚â• N .\\n\\nMore compactly and informally spoken, deÔ¨Ånition 2.13 demands preference on all\\napproximations with Ô¨Ånite support except for at most Ô¨Ånitely many exceptions near the\\norigin.\\n\\nObviously, preference among distributions with Ô¨Ånite support implies the extended\\npreference relation to hold in exactly the same way (since the sequence of approxima-\\ntions will ultimately become constant when an overshoots the bound of the support), so\\ndeÔ¨Ånition 2.13 extends the (cid:22)-relation in this sense. This observation justiÔ¨Åes our choice\\nof deÔ¨Ånition 2.13 as a valid extension of (cid:22) from distributions with compact support to\\nthose with inÔ¨Ånite support.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the extended (cid:22)-relation is not as easy to decide as (extended) strict\\npreference and usually calls for computing the moment sequences analytically to be able\\nto compare them in the long run.\\n\\nNevertheless, example 2.10 substantiates the expectation that practically relevant dis-\\ntributions over R+ may indeed compare w.r.t. ‚â∫ or (cid:31) by deÔ¨Ånition 2.9 or criterion (13).\\nWhile it is easy to exhibit distributions with inÔ¨Ånite support that ‚â∫-compare in the\\nsense of deÔ¨Ånition 2.13, their practical relevance or even occurrence is not guaranteed.\\nExample 2.14, however, shows that preference relations are indeed non-empty if they are\\ndeÔ¨Åned like (9) for distributions with inÔ¨Ånite support.\\n\\n22\\n\\n\\x0cN. Furthermore, let us construct another sequence (bn)n\\n‚àà\\n\\nExample 2.14 Let X ‚àº F1 be a Gaussian random variable. It is well-known that any\\nGaussian distribution has Ô¨Ånite moments of all orders, so let us call the resulting se-\\nquence (an)n\\nN being identical\\n‚àà\\nN, except for Ô¨Ånitely many indices I = {i1, i2, . . . , ik} for which we choose\\nto (an)n\\n‚àà\\nbj < aj whenever j ‚àà I and bj := aj otherwise. It is easy to see that the existence of\\nthe moment-generating function ¬µX for F1 implies the existence of a moment-generating\\nN (since the\\nfunction ¬µY for a random variable Y ‚àº F2 that has moment sequence (bn)n\\n‚àà\\npower-series ¬µX dominates the series ¬µY ). However, it is equally clear that ¬µX (cid:54)= ¬µY .\\nThus, F1 (cid:54)= F2 although F1 ‚â° F2, since the mismatch is only on Ô¨Ånitely many indices,\\nand the complement set of these must be in the ultraÔ¨Ålter.\\n\\n2.6 Interpretation and Implications of Preferences\\n\\nHaving deÔ¨Åned preferences among probability distributions, we now look at what F1 (cid:22)\\nF2 actually means. A simple Ô¨Årst impression is gained by considering cases in which the\\nÔ¨Årst few moments match. For that sake, let F1, F2 be two distributions for which no\\npreference has been determined so far.\\n\\n‚Ä¢ If ¬µ1 = E(F1) < ¬µ2 = E(F2), then we prefer the distribution with smaller mean.\\n\\nThat is, decisions that yield to less average risk would be (cid:22)-preferred.\\n\\n‚Ä¢ If the means are equal, then we prefer whatever distribution has smaller second\\nIn other words, the preferred among\\nmoment (by virtue of Steiner‚Äôs theorem).\\nF1, F2 would be the one with smaller variance, or otherwise said, the distribution\\nwhose outcome is ‚Äúmore predictable‚Äù in the sense of varying less around its mean.\\n\\n‚Ä¢ Upon equal mean and variance, the third moment would make the diÔ¨Äerence. This\\nmoment is the skewness, and we would prefer the distribution for which E(cid:0)X 3(cid:1)\\nis smaller, i.e., the distribution that ‚Äúleans more to the left‚Äù. The respective\\ndistribution would assign more likelihood to smaller outcomes, thus giving less\\nrisk.\\n\\nWe refrain here from extending the above intuitions to cover cases when kurtosis tips\\nthe scale, as the physical meaning of this quantity is debatable and no consensus among\\nstatisticians exists so far. Instead, we give the following result that makes the above\\nintuitions more explicit in the sense of (under certain hypotheses) saying that:\\n\\nIf F1 (cid:22) F2, then ‚Äúextreme events‚Äù are less likely to occur under F1 than\\nunder F2.\\n\\nThe rigorous version of this, which especially clariÔ¨Åes the adjective ‚Äúextreme‚Äù, is the\\nfollowing theorem:\\n\\nTheorem 2.15 Let X1 ‚àº F1, X2 ‚àº F2, where F1, F2 satisfy assumption 1.3 on the joint\\nsupport ‚Ñ¶ = supp(F1)‚à™supp(F2) = [a, b]. Furthermore, let f1, f2 be the density functions\\non ‚Ñ¶, and assume f1(b) (cid:54)= f2(b). If F1 (cid:22) F2, then there exists a threshold x0 ‚àà ‚Ñ¶ so that\\nfor every x ‚â• x0, we have Pr(X1 > x) ‚â§ Pr(X2 > x).\\n\\n23\\n\\n\\x0cProof. Let f1, f2 be the density functions of F1, F2. Call ‚Ñ¶ = supp(F1)‚à™supp(F2) = [0, a]\\nthe common support of both densities, and take Œæ = inf {x ‚àà ‚Ñ¶ : f1(x) = f2(x) = 0}.\\nSuppose there were an Œµ > 0 so that f1 > f2 on every interval [Œæ ‚àí Œ¥, Œæ] whenever Œ¥ < Œµ,\\ni.e., f1 would be larger than f2 until both densities vanish (notice that f1 = f2 = 0\\non the right of Œæ). Then the proof of lemma 2.4 delivers the argument by which we\\nwould Ô¨Ånd a K ‚àà N so that E(cid:0)X k\\n(cid:1) for every k ‚â• K, which would contradict\\n(cid:1) > E(cid:0)X k\\n1\\n2\\nF1 (cid:22) F2. Therefore, there must be a neighborhood [Œæ ‚àí Œ¥, Œæ] on which f1(x) ‚â§ f2(x)\\nfor all x ‚àà [Œæ ‚àí Œ¥, Œæ]. The claim follows immediately by setting x0 = Œæ ‚àí Œ¥, since\\ntaking x ‚â• x0, we end up with (cid:82) Œæ\\nx f1(t)dt ‚â§ (cid:82) Œæ\\nx f2(t)dt, and for i = 1, 2 we have\\nx fi(t)dt = (cid:82) a\\n(cid:82) Œæ\\n(cid:3)\\nx fi(t)dt = Pr(Xi > x).\\n\\nObserve that this is compatible with the common goals of statistical risk management\\n[7] in other sectors, such as Ô¨Ånancial business: the preference-relation (cid:22) compares the\\ntails of distributions, and optimization w.r.t. (cid:22) seeks to ‚Äúpush‚Äù the mass assigned by a\\ndistribution towards lower damages. Essentially, we thus focus on large deviations (dam-\\nages), which intuitively makes sense, as small deviations from the expected behavior may\\n(most likely) be taken by the system‚Äôs (designed) natural resilience against distortions.\\nWe close this section by giving a few examples showing graphically how diÔ¨Äerent\\n\\ndistributions compare against each other.\\n\\nExample 2.16 (diÔ¨Äerent mean, same variance) Consider two Gumbel-distributions\\nX ‚àº F1 = Gumbel(31.0063, 1.74346) and Y ‚àº F2 = Gumbel(32.0063, 1.74346), where a\\ndensity for Gumbel(a, b) is given by\\n\\nf (x|a, b) =\\n\\nx\\n\\na\\n‚àí\\nb ‚àí\\n\\ne\\n\\ne\\n\\nx\\n\\na\\n\\n‚àí\\nb\\n\\n,\\n\\n1\\nb\\n\\nwhere a ‚àà R and b > 0 are the location and scale parameter.\\n\\nFigure 2: Comparing distributions with diÔ¨Äerent means\\n\\nComputations reveal that under the given parameters, the means are E(X) = 30, E(Y ) =\\n31 and Var (X) = Var (Y ) = 5.

This is consistent with the intuition that the preferred\\ndistribution gives less expected damage.\\n\\nExample 2.17 (same mean, diÔ¨Äerent variance) Let us now consider two Gumbel-\\ndistributions X ‚àº F1 = Gumbel(6.27294, 2.20532) and Y ‚àº F2 = Gumbel(6.19073, 2.06288),\\nfor which E(X) = E(Y ) = 5 but Var (X) = 8 > Var (Y ) = 7.\\n\\nFigure 3: Comparing distributions with equal means but diÔ¨Äerent variance\\n\\nFigure 3 plots the respective densities of F1 (dashed) and F2 (solid line).

This is consistent with the intuition that among two actions\\nleading to the same expected loss, the preferred one would be one for which the variation\\naround the mean is smaller; thus the loss prediction is ‚Äúmore stable‚Äù.\\n\\nExample 2.18 (diÔ¨Äerent distributions, same mean and variance) Let us now con-\\nsider a situation in which the expected loss (Ô¨Årst moment) and variation around the mean\\n(second moment) are equal, but the distributions are diÔ¨Äerent in terms of their shape.\\nSpeciÔ¨Åcally, let X ‚àº F1 = Gamma(260.345, 0.0373929) and Y ‚àº W eibull(20, 10), with\\ndensities as follows:\\n\\nfGamma(x|a, b) =\\n\\n(cid:40) b‚àí\\n\\naxa\\n\\n1e‚àí\\n\\n‚àí\\nŒì(a)\\n0,\\n\\nx\\nb\\n\\n,\\n\\nx > 0;\\notherwise\\n\\n25\\n\\n\\x0cfWeibull(x|a, b) =\\n\\n\\uf8f1\\n\\uf8f2\\n\\n\\uf8f3\\n\\nae‚àí( x\\n\\nb )a\\n( x\\n\\n1\\n\\n‚àí\\n\\nb )a\\nb\\n0,\\n\\n,\\n\\nx > 0;\\notherwise\\n\\nFigure 4: Comparing distributions with matching Ô¨Årst two moments but diÔ¨Äerent shapes\\n\\nFigure 4 plots the respective densities of F1 (dashed) and F2 (solid line).

In this case, going with the distribution that visually ‚Äú‚Äòleans\\nmore towards lower damages‚Äù would be Ô¨Çawed, since F1 nonetheless assigns larger like-\\nlihood to larger damages. The moment sequence, on the contrary, unambiguously points\\nout F2 as the preferred distribution. This illustrates Theorem 2.15.\\n\\n3 Games with Uncertain PayoÔ¨Äs\\n\\nGiven a total ordering (cid:22) on the set of actions as deÔ¨Åned in section 2, we can go on lifting\\nthe remaining concepts and results of game theory to our new setting. In particular,\\nwe will have to investigate zero-sum competitions and Nash-equilibria in games whose\\npayoÔ¨Äs are probability distributions. Before, however, it pays to look at arithmetics in\\nour chosen subset of hyperreal numbers that represent our payoÔ¨Ä distributions. It turns\\nout that things cannot be straightforwardly be carried over, as we will illustrate in the\\nnext section.\\n\\n3.1 Arithmetic in F ‚äÇ R‚àû/U\\nThe space R‚àû/U is elsewhere known as the set of hyperreal numbers. Together with\\nthe ordering relation deÔ¨Åned in the same way as (9), and because U is an ultraÔ¨Ålter, F\\nis actually a Ô¨Åeld, and in many ways behaves like the real numbers. This is due to the\\n\\n26\\n\\n\\x0cultraÔ¨Ålter acts in much the same way as a maximal ideal, when the quotient structure is\\nformed. For example, we can soundly deÔ¨Åne min- and max-operators on F. Furthermore,\\nwe can add and subtract elements from F in the canonical way by applying the respective\\noperation pairwise on the sequences‚Äô elements. Likewise, we can deÔ¨Åne an absolute-value\\nfunction |x| = (|xi|)i\\nN on the sequences, which naturally satisÔ¨Åes the triangle inequality\\nbecause the sequence‚Äôs elements are from R. However, we stress that the absolute value\\ndoes not induce a metric on F (even though it satisÔ¨Åes the necessary conditions), as the\\nabsolute value under this deÔ¨Ånition is not real-valued. This is one diÔ¨Äerence to the Ô¨Åeld\\nR.\\n\\n‚àà\\n\\nA more important diÔ¨Äerence is the observation that any probability distribution sat-\\nisfying assumption 1.3 can be represented by an element in F, but the converse is not\\ntrue! For instance, given F ‚àà F as a representative of some probability distribution, the\\nelement (‚àíF ) as being the sequence of moments of F , only with negative signs, does not\\nrepresent a distribution (in general, and speciÔ¨Åcally under assumption 1.3). Neither is\\nthe sum of two moments necessarily the moment of some other probability distribution.\\nFinally, observe that the zero element 0 = (0, 0, . . .) does not deÔ¨Åne a proper probability\\ndistribution. Hence, the concept of a ‚Äúzero-sum game‚Äù must be replaced by the (strate-\\ngically equivalent) concept of a constant-sum game, to properly deÔ¨Åne things. This issue\\nwill not be of any particular importance in the following.\\n\\nOur proofs will nevertheless heavily rely on the existence of a well-deÔ¨Åned ordering\\nand arithmetic on the subset F of the hyperreals. The fact that in lack of an explicit\\nrepresentation of U we cannot do arbitrary arithmetic somewhat limits the candidate\\nalgorithms to analyze the games and compute equilibria and security strategies, however,\\nthis limitation is not severe and can be overcome in our context of application.\\n\\n3.2 Continuity of F (p, q)(r) in (p, q)\\n\\nThe existence of Nash-equilibria crucially hinges on the continuity of payoÔ¨Ä functionals\\n(in the classical setting). The existence of a topology on the hyperreal set that we\\nconsider lets us soundly deÔ¨Åne continuity in terms of the topology, but proving our\\npayoÔ¨Ä distribution function (3) to be continuous is so far an open issue, and this gap\\nshall be closed now.\\n\\nTo establish continuity of the distribution-valued utility function u(p, q) := F (p, q)\\nwe have to show that any set in the topology T , i.e., any open set in F, has a preimage\\nunder u that is open in S1 √ó S2 w.r.t.\\nthe product topology. The following lemma\\nestablishes the important steps towards this conclusion by exploiting the ordering and\\narithmetic within F. Hereafter, we consider (F ‚äÇ R‚àû/U, T , ‚â∫) as an ordered topological\\nspace induced by an arbitrary ultraÔ¨Ålter U.\\n\\nLemma 3.1 Let r1, . . . , rk ‚àà F for k ‚â• 1 be a set of Ô¨Åxed elements, and take Œ± =\\n(Œ±1, . . . , Œ±k) ‚àà Rk. If two elements (cid:96), u ‚àà F bound the weighted sum (cid:96) ‚â∫ (cid:80)k\\ni=1 Œ±iri =\\nŒ±T r ‚â∫ u, then there is some strictly positive Œ¥ ‚àà R so that (cid:96) ‚â∫ (cid:101)Œ±T r ‚â∫ u for every (cid:101)Œ±\\nwithin a Œ¥-neighborhood of Œ± in Rk.\\n\\n27\\n\\n\\x0cProof. DeÔ¨Åne ‚àÜ := min (cid:8)Œ±T r ‚àí (cid:96), u ‚àí Œ±T r(cid:9) (cid:31) 0 and r := max {r1, . . . , rk}. Suppose\\nthat we would modify all weights Œ±i to Œ±i+Œ¥i = (cid:101)Œ±i. If so, then the so-modiÔ¨Åed sum diÔ¨Äers\\nfrom the given one by (cid:12)\\n(cid:12) ‚â§ (cid:80)k\\ni=1 |Œ¥i|. Now, suppose that all\\n|Œ¥i| ‚â§ Œ¥, then the change alters Œ±T r by a magnitude of no more than r ¬∑ (cid:80)k\\ni=1 Œ¥i ‚â§ r ¬∑ k ¬∑ Œ¥.\\nAs k and r are Ô¨Åxed, we can choose Œ¥ suÔ¨Éciently small to satisfy r ¬∑ k ¬∑ Œ¥ ‚â∫ ‚àÜ, in which\\ncase we must have (cid:12)\\n(cid:12) < ‚àÜ, and therefore (cid:96) ‚â∫ (cid:101)Œ±T r ‚â∫ u for any choice of (cid:101)Œ±\\n(cid:3)\\nwithin an Œ¥-neighborhood of Œ± in the maximum-norm on Rk.\\n\\ni=1 |Œ¥i| ri ‚â§ r ¬∑ (cid:80)k\\n\\n(cid:12) (cid:101)Œ±T r ‚àí Œ±T r(cid:12)\\n\\n(cid:12) (cid:101)Œ±T r ‚àí Œ±T r(cid:12)\\n\\nBy virtue of lemma 3.1, continuity of F (p, q) is easily implied by the continuity of the\\n\\nweights Cp,q(i, j) in (p, q).\\n\\nProposition 3.2 Let i, j be integers and deÔ¨Åne the function Dij\\nDij(p, q) = Cp,q(i, j) = Prp,q(i, j).\\ntion 1.3, then the mapping F : S1 √ó S2 ‚Üí F; (p, q) (cid:55)‚Üí (cid:80)\\nw.r.t. the product topology on S1 √ó S2 and the order topology on F.\\n\\n: S1 √ó S2 ‚Üí R as\\nIf Dij is continuous and all Fij satisfy assump-\\ni,j Cp,q(i, j)Fij is continuous\\n\\nProof. Without a metric on F, we need to show that the preimage of every open set\\nin F under F is open to prove that F is continuous. For that sake, let the open set\\n((cid:96), u) ‚àà T be arbitrary and contain some point F (p, q) (which must exist, for otherwise,\\nthe set of preimages would be empty). To ease notation, let us Ô¨Çatten the double-sum\\n(cid:80)\\ni,j into an ordinary sum (say, by introducing a multiindex ŒΩ) over k = n ¬∑ m elements,\\nwhere n, m are the limits in the original expression. Then, the mapping takes the form\\nF (p, q) = (cid:80)k\\nŒΩ=1 DŒΩ(p, q)FŒΩ. With the weights Œ± being deÔ¨Åned by the individual values\\nof DŒΩ(p, q) = Cp,q(ŒΩ), we can apply lemma 3.1 to establish a bound Œ¥ > 0 within which\\nwe can arbitrarily alter the weights towards (cid:101)Œ± without leaving the open set ((cid:96), u). Since\\nC is continuous on compact S1 √ó S2 it is also uniformly continuous, and we can Ô¨Åx a\\nŒ¥(cid:48) > 0 so that (cid:107)DŒΩ(p(cid:48), q(cid:48)) ‚àí DŒΩ(p, q)(cid:107) < Œ¥ whenever (cid:107)(p, q) ‚àí (p(cid:48), q(cid:48))(cid:107) < Œ¥(cid:48), indepen-\\ndently of the particular point (p, q). The sought pre-image of the open set ((cid:96), u) is thus\\nthe (inÔ¨Ånite) union of open neighborhoods constructed in the way described, and thus\\n(cid:3)\\nitself open.\\n\\n3.3 Security Strategies and Zero-Sum Games\\n\\nGiven the continuity and ordering of payoÔ¨Äs in games that reward players with random\\nvariables, our next step is the deÔ¨Ånition of zero-sum games in this context. We rephrase\\nthe standard deÔ¨Ånition of a zero-sum equilibrium using the preference relation (cid:22) in the\\nstraightforward fashion, by deÔ¨Åning a two-person game Œì0 = ({1, 2} , {S1, S2} , {F, ‚àíF })\\nas usual, but keeping the following in mind:\\n\\n‚Ä¢ When (ai)‚àûi=1 deÔ¨Ånes the probability distribution F , then ‚àíF is deÔ¨Åned by (‚àíai)‚àûi=1,\\nbut not necessarily deÔ¨Ånes a valid probability distribution any more. To see this,\\nsimply recall that the Taylor-series (6) would upon all negative moments deÔ¨Åne a\\nnegative-valued function ¬µX (s) < 0, which cannot be a moment-generating func-\\ntion, since ¬µX (s) = E(cid:0)esX (cid:1) ‚â• 0 in any case.\\n\\n28\\n\\n\\x0c‚Ä¢ The sum F + (‚àíF ) being computed in R‚àû/U is deÔ¨Åned as the sequence that is\\nconstantly zero. Again, this does not deÔ¨Åne a probability distribution in the proper\\nsense. However, strategic equivalence (as in the classical theory of games) tells the\\nset of equilibria does not change if the payoÔ¨Äs of both players get a constant value\\nadded to them (in that case, the payoÔ¨Äs on either side are changed by the same\\nvalue, leaving all inequalities intact). By the same token, we may think of constant-\\nsum games, which avoid degenerate cases as above (where two distributions add\\nup to something that is no longer a distribution).\\n\\nThe familiar equilibrium condition in a two-player zero-sum game Œì can be rephrased\\nas follows: a strategy proÔ¨Åle (p‚àó, q‚àó) ‚àà S1 √ó S2 is a (Nash-)equilibrium, if for every\\n(p, q) ‚àà S1 √ó S2,\\n\\nF (p, q‚àó) (cid:22) F (p‚àó, q‚àó) (cid:22) F (p‚àó, q),\\n\\n(14)\\n\\ni.e., any deviation from the optimal proÔ¨Åle (p‚àó, q‚àó) would worsen the situation of either\\nplayer (in either a zero- or constant-sum competition).\\n\\nBefore security strategies can be deÔ¨Åned properly, we need to assure existence of\\nequilibria proÔ¨Åles in our modiÔ¨Åed setting. In this regard, Glicksberg‚Äôs theorem, which\\ngeneralizes Nash‚Äôs original theorem, helps out:\\n\\nTheorem 3.3 (see [4] and [3, Theorem 1.3]) Consider a strategic-form game whose\\nstrategy spaces Si are nonempty compact subsets of a metric space. If the payoÔ¨Ä func-\\ntions are continuous w.r.t.\\nthe metric, then there exists a Nash-equilibrium in mixed\\nstrategies.\\n\\nIt is a simple matter to verify that\\n\\n‚Ä¢ both sets P S1, P S2 are Ô¨Ånite subsets of R (or Rd for d > 1) and hence compact\\n\\nw.r.t. all norms on this Euclidian space, and\\n\\n‚Ä¢ the payoÔ¨Ä functions are continuous by lemma 3.2,\\n\\nso that a Nash-equilibrium in the sense of (14) exists by theorem 3.3.\\n\\nFurthermore, any saddle-point satisfying (14) deÔ¨Ånes the same payoÔ¨Ä distribution in\\nthe sense of possibly deÔ¨Åning a diÔ¨Äerent representative but in any case pinning down\\nthe same equivalence class of distributions in R‚àû/ ‚â°, where ‚â° is deÔ¨Åned by (10). The\\nproof is a restatement of Theorem 3.12 in [11].\\n\\nLemma 3.4 Let a continuous function F : P S1 √ó P S2 ‚Üí F be given, where P S1 ‚äÜ\\nRn1, P S2 ‚äÜ Rn2. Furthermore, let (p(cid:48), q(cid:48)) and (p‚àó, q‚àó) be two diÔ¨Äerent saddle-points .\\nThen, (p‚àó, q(cid:48)) and (p(cid:48), q‚àó) are also saddle-points, and\\n\\nF (p(cid:48), q(cid:48)) ‚â° F (p‚àó, q‚àó) ‚â° F (p‚àó, q(cid:48)) ‚â° F (p(cid:48), q‚àó).\\n\\nProof. The proof is by direct checking of the saddle-point condition, i.e.,\\n\\nF (p‚àó, q(cid:48)) (cid:22) F (p(cid:48), q(cid:48)) (cid:22) F (p(cid:48), q‚àó) (cid:22) F (p‚àó, q‚àó) (cid:22) F (p‚àó, q(cid:48))\\n\\n‚áíF (p(cid:48), q(cid:48)) ‚â° F (p‚àó, q‚àó) ‚â° F (p(cid:48), q‚àó) ‚â° F (p‚àó, q(cid:48)).\\n\\n29\\n\\n\\x0c(p(cid:48), q‚àó) is saddle-point,\\n\\nF (p, q‚àó) (cid:22) F (p‚àó, q‚àó) ‚â° F (p(cid:48), q‚àó) ‚â° F (p(cid:48), q(cid:48)) (cid:22) F (p(cid:48), q).\\n\\nThe fact that (p‚àó, q(cid:48)) is a saddle-point is proved analogously.\\n\\n(cid:3)\\n\\nLemma 3.4 permits calling v ‚â° F (p‚àó, q‚àó) the saddle-point value of the zero-sum game\\n\\nŒì0. With this, we are ready to step forward towards deÔ¨Åning security strategies.\\n\\nFor security strategies in the general case of two-person games with arbitrary payoÔ¨Äs,\\nlet us denote the general game by Œì = ({1, 2} , {S1, S2} , {F, G}), in which player 1 has\\npayoÔ¨Ä structure F , and player 2 has payoÔ¨Ä structure G. Let Œì0 denote the associated\\nzero-sum competition that ‚Äì adopting a worst-case assumption ‚Äì substitutes an unknown\\nG by (‚àíF ), i.e., Œì0 = ({1, 2} , {S1, S2} , {F, ‚àíF }).\\n\\nTheorem 3.5 Let Œì be an arbitrary two-person game, and let Œì0 be its associated zero-\\nsum competition with equilibrium proÔ¨Åle (p‚àó, q‚àó). Then, for every (p, q) ‚àà S1 √ó S2, we\\nhave\\n\\nv (cid:22) F (p, q),\\n\\n(15)\\n\\nand the strategy q‚àó achieves equality in (15).\\n\\nProof. Observe that the payoÔ¨Ä F (p, q) is the same for player 1 in both games Œì and\\nŒì0. So, if player 1 follows an equilibrium proÔ¨Åle (p‚àó, q‚àó) of Œì0, then the saddle-point\\ncondition (14) yields\\n\\nv ‚â° F (p‚àó, q‚àó) (cid:22) F (p‚àó, q),\\n\\n(16)\\n\\nfor every q, with equality being achieved by q‚àó, obviously. Since player 2 will play to the\\nbest of its own beneÔ¨Åt in Œì, call the equilibrium proÔ¨Åle in Œì (which exists by theorem\\n3.3) (p, q). In Œì, however, player 1 deviates by playing p‚àó thus increasing the payoÔ¨Ä for\\nplayer 2. Thus, we can continue inequality (16) on the right side towards\\n\\nThe theorem is now immediate from expressions (16) and (17).\\n\\nF (p‚àó, q) (cid:22) F (p, q).\\n\\n(17)\\n\\n(cid:3)\\n\\n4 Optimizing Multiple Security Goals\\n\\nIn case of multiple goals to be defended, we turn the two conclusions of theorem 3.5 for\\nscalar-valued games into two axioms on vector-valued games. This leads to the following\\ndeÔ¨Ånition from [9]:\\n\\nDeÔ¨Ånition 4.1 (Multi-Goal Security Strategy with Assurance)\\nA strategy p‚àó ‚àà S1 in a two-person multi-criteria game with continuous payoÔ¨Ä u1 :\\nS1 √ó S2 ‚Üí Fd for the service provider (player 1), is called a Multi-Goal Security Strategy\\nwith Assurance (MGSS) with assurance v = (V1, . . . , Vd) ‚àà Fd if two criteria are met:\\n\\n30\\n\\n\\x0cAxiom 1: Assurance The values in v are the component-wise guaranteed payoÔ¨Ä for\\n\\nplayer 1, i.e. for all components i, we have\\n\\nVi (cid:22) u(i)\\n\\n1 (p‚àó, q)\\n\\n‚àÄq ‚àà S2,\\n\\n(18)\\n\\nwith equality being achieved by at least one choice qi ‚àà S2.\\n\\nAxiom 2: EÔ¨Éciency At least one assurance becomes void if player 1 deviates from p‚àó\\nby playing p (cid:54)= p‚àó. In that case, some qp ‚àà S2 exists (that depends on p) such that\\n\\nu1(p, qp) (cid:22)1 v.\\n\\n(19)\\n\\n4.1 Characterization and Existence of Security Strategies\\n\\nThe existence of MGSS in the sense of deÔ¨Ånition 4.1 hinges on a few basic facts about\\ncontinuous real-valued functions. Fortunately, it turns out that the only ingredient\\nneeded is uniform continuity of payoÔ¨Äs on compact strategy spaces. The precise fact\\nused to establish the existence of multi-criteria security strategies is the following [9]:\\n\\nLet u1 : P S1 √ó P S2 ‚Üí Rd be player 1‚Äôs payoÔ¨Ä function, and let it be continu-\\nous. Since P S1 √ó P S2 is compact, given any Œµ > 0, we can Ô¨Ånd a Œ¥ > 0 such\\nthat (cid:107)u1(x, y) ‚àí u1(x(cid:48), y(cid:48))(cid:107)\\n\\n< Œµ, whenever (cid:107)x ‚àí y(cid:107)\\n\\n< Œ¥.\\n\\n‚àû\\n\\n‚àû\\n\\nThis argument can be transferred easily to our setting, by a simple inspection of the\\nproofs of lemma 3.1 and proposition 3.2.\\n\\n|¬∑|\\n\\nP S2\\n\\nProposition 3.2 tells that F : S1 √ó S2 ‚Üí F is continuous w.r.t.\\nP S1\\n\\nthe topologies on\\nR|\\n| and the ordering topology on F. So, let (‚àíŒµ, +Œµ) for 0 ‚â∫ Œµ ‚àà F be an open\\n< Œ¥,\\ninterval, then we can Ô¨Ånd some real Œ¥ > 0 such that whenever (cid:107)(p, q) ‚àí (p(cid:48), q(cid:48))(cid:107)\\nwe have ‚àíŒµ ‚â∫ F (p, q) ‚àí F (p(cid:48), q(cid:48)) ‚â∫ Œµ by construction of Œ¥ (see the proofs of lemma\\n3.1 and proposition 3.2). More importantly, the Œ¥ is constructed only from Œµ but is\\nindependent of (p, q). Hence, F is indeed uniformly continuous 6. For vector-valued\\npayoÔ¨Äs F : (p, q) (cid:55)‚Üí (F (1)(p, q), . . . , F (d)(p, q)), uniform continuity is inherited in the\\ncanonical way.\\n\\n‚àû\\n\\nFurthermore, we need a proper replacement for the ‚àû-norm on Rd, which will work\\non elements x ‚àà Fd. This replacement is\\n:= max {|x1| , . . . , |xd|}\\nx\\n(cid:75)‚àû\\n(cid:74)\\nfor (x1, . . . , xd) ‚àà Fd, which ‚Äúresembles‚Äù the ‚àû-norm on the real space.

The main result needed here will be theorem 4.4, whose\\nproof will then rest on our version of lemma 4.2.\\n\\n6The deÔ¨Ånition on topological spaces (without relying on a metric) is the following: a function f : X ‚Üí Y\\nis uniformly continuous, if for any neighborhood B of zero in Y , there is a neighborhood A of zero in\\nX so that x ‚àí y ‚àà A implies f (x) ‚àí f (y) ‚àà B. This deÔ¨Ånition is satsiÔ¨Åed by our ‚Äúdistribution-valued‚Äù\\nfunction F : S1 √ó S2 ‚Üí F.\\n\\n31\\n\\n\\x0cLemma 4.2 Let Œì be a multi-criteria game, and let p‚àó be a multi-goal security provi-\\nsioning strategy with assurance v, assuming that one exists.

The scenario is a\\n‚Äúone-against-all‚Äù game, for which numerical solution techniques (e.g., Ô¨Åctitious play) are\\nknown. This is subject of upcoming companion work.\\n\\nDeÔ¨Ånition 4.3 (Auxiliary Game) Let a multiobjective game\\n\\nŒì = ({1, 2} , {S1, S2} , {F1, F2})\\n\\nbe given, where player 1 receives d ‚â• 1 outcomes through the (known) payoÔ¨Ä F1 =\\n(F (1)\\n).

The proof from [9] transfers with obvious changes to our setting, except\\n(cid:3)\\nfor the above version of Lemma 4.2 being used in the last step.\\n\\nTheorem 4.4 equates the set of multi-goal security strategies to the set of Pareto-Nash\\nequilibria in a conventional game. Existence of such equilibria is assured by the following\\ntheorem:\\n\\nTheorem 4.5 ([6]) Let Œì = ({1, . . . , p} , {S1, . . . , Sp} , {F1, . . . , Fp}) be a p-player mul-\\ntiobjective game, where S1, . . . , Sp are convex compact sets and F1, . . . , Fp represent\\nvector-valued continuous payoÔ¨Ä functions (where payoÔ¨Ä for player i is composed from\\nri ‚â• 1 values). Moreover, let us assume that for every i ‚àà {1, 2, . . . , p} each component\\nF (k)\\n1, si, si+1, . . . , sp), k ‚àà {1, 2, . . . , ri}, of the vector function Fi repre-\\ni\\nsents a concave function w.r.t. si on Si for Ô¨Åxed s1, . . . , si\\n1, si+1, . . . , sp. Then the\\nmultiobjective game Œì has a Pareto-Nash equilibrium.\\n\\n(s1, s2, . . . , si\\n\\n‚àí\\n\\n‚àí\\n\\nIt is almost straightforward to apply theorem 4.5, since almost all conditions have been\\nveriÔ¨Åed already: we have p = 2 players, whose (vector-valued) payoÔ¨Äs are continuous\\nby proposition 3.2, transferred canonically to the vector-valued case (which means that\\nplayer 0 in the auxiliary game has r0 = d payoÔ¨Äs, and every opponent i = 1, . . . , d has\\nri = 1 payoÔ¨Ä). Likewise, the action spaces P S1, P S2 that we consider are Ô¨Ånite subsets\\nof R, and hence the simplex of discrete probability distributions S1, S2 are compact and\\nconvex sets. However, it remains generally open whether or not the payoÔ¨Ä functions are\\nconcave. Under independent choices of actions ‚Äì cf. section 2.1 ‚Äì this is assured, and\\ntheorem 4.5 applies. However, if the actions are chosen interdependently, i.e., we have\\na nontrivial copula modeling the interplay, concavity of the payoÔ¨Äs must be determined\\nupon the explicit structure of (4).\\n\\n4.2 Relation to Bayesian Decisions\\n\\nTo embed the minimax-like decision Ô¨Ånding that we described in a Bayesian frame-\\nthe a-posteriori\\nwork, recall that a Bayesian decision is one that is optimal w.r.t.\\nloss-distribution that incorporates all information.\\nInformally spoken, such decisions\\nnaturally give rise to minimax-decisions, if the loss-distribution is the least favourable\\none. Our minimax approach, on the contrary, has the opponent player 2 look exactly\\nfor this least favourable distribution, and the zero-sum assumption then implies that\\na multi-goal security strategy in the sense of 4.1 can be viewed as a Bayesian decision\\nw.r.t. the Pareto-Nash opponent-strategy in the ‚Äúzero-sum‚Äù auxiliary game associated\\nwith our multi-criteria competition (cf. theorem 4.5).\\n\\n33\\n\\n\\x0cA full Ô¨Çedged treatment of Bayesian decision theory can be found in [10]. We abstain\\nfrom transferring this framework to our setting, as there appears to be no immediate\\nbeneÔ¨Åt in doing so, due of the inherent lack of information that risk management here.\\nIn other words, while Bayesian decisions heavily rely on data, such data is not usually\\navailable in the context of security and defenses against unknown attackers. Attacks like\\neavesdropping are intrinsically unobservable (in most practically relevant cases), and the\\nconsequences may be observed delayed and under fuzzyness.\\n\\nSumming up, minimax decision as we compute them here may indeed be pessimistic\\nrelative to a ‚Äúmore informed‚Äù Bayesian decision. Under the expected lack of information\\nthat risk management often suÔ¨Äers from, however, it is nevertheless the best that we can\\ndo (theoretically).\\n\\n5 Compiling Quantitative Risk Measures\\n\\nThe outcome of the game-theoretic analysis is in any case two-fold, consisting of:\\n\\n‚Ä¢ An optimal choice rule p‚àó over the set of actions P S1, and\\n\\n‚Ä¢ An lower-bound distribution V ‚àó (or vector v if we optimize multiple goals as in\\nsection 4) for the random payoÔ¨Ä that can be obtained from the game. This payoÔ¨Ä\\nis optimal in the sense of not being improvable without risking the existence of\\nan attack strategy that causes greater damage than predicted by V ‚àó. This bound\\nis valid if and only if actions are drawn at random from P S1 according to the\\ndistribution p‚àó.\\n\\nWhile the optimal action choice distribution p‚àó is easy to interpret, compiling crisp\\nrisk Ô¨Ågures from the payoÔ¨Ä value V ‚àó (or a vector v thereof) requires some more thoughts.\\n\\nA common approach to risk quantisation is by the well-known ‚Äúrule-of-thumb‚Äù\\n\\nrisk = (incident likelihood) √ó (damage caused by the incident),\\n\\n(20)\\n\\nThe beauty of this formula lies in its compatibility with any nominal or numerical scale\\nof likelihoods and damages, while at the same time, it enjoys a rigorous mathematical\\nfundament, part of which is game theory.\\n\\nIndeed, formula (20) is essentially the expected value of the loss-distribution that is\\nspeciÔ¨Åed by the damage potential of all known incidents, together with their likelihoods.\\nThe distribution V ‚àó that we obtain from our analysis of games with distribution-valued\\nlet v be the optimal distribution,\\npayoÔ¨Äs is much more general and thus informative:\\nthen:\\n\\n‚Ä¢ Formula (20) is merely the Ô¨Årst moment of V ‚àó, i.e.,\\n\\nrisk = likelihood √ó damage = E(R) , when R ‚àº V ‚àó\\nwhere the last quantity is equal to E(V ‚àó) = E(cid:0)R1(cid:1) (p‚àó, q‚àó) that can be computed\\nfrom equation (5). The missing value q‚àó is here exactly the optimal strategy for the\\n\\n34\\n\\n\\x0cattacker in the hypothetical zero-sum competition that is set up to compute the\\nsought security strategy p‚àó. In other words, the value q‚àó is a natural by-product\\nof the computation of p‚àó and delivered together with it.\\n\\n‚Ä¢ Beyond the crisp result that formula (20) delivers, the distribution V can be an-\\nalyzed for higher moments too, such as variance of the damage, or quantiles that\\nwould provide us with probabilistic risk bounds: for example, computing the 5%-\\nand 95%-quantiles of V gives two bounds within the damage will range with a\\n90% likelihood. This may be another interesting Ô¨Ågure for decision support, which\\ncannot be obtained on the classical way via formula (20).\\n\\nIf the results refer to a MGSS, then the above reasoning holds for every component of the\\nassurance vector v = (V ‚àó1 , . . . , V ‚àód ). That is, risk Ô¨Ågures can be computed independently\\nfor every aspect of interest.\\n\\nRemark 5.1 The entries in the optimal attack strategy q‚àó are an optimal choice rule\\nover the set of attacker‚Äôs actions P S2. As such, they can be taken as indicators to\\nneuralgic spots in the infrastructure. However, it must be emphasized that equilibria,\\nand hence also security strategies, are notoriously non-unique. Therefore, the indication\\nby q‚àó is only one among many other possible ones, and thus must not be used isolated\\nfrom or as a substitute for other/further information and expertise.\\n\\nRemark 5.2 As an alternative quantity of interest, one may ask for the expected maxi-\\nmum repair costs over a duration of (unchanging) infrastructure provisioning p and risk\\nsituation q. In adopting such an approach, we can put Mn := max {R1, . . . , Rn}, but\\nthen Ô¨Ånd\\n\\nPr(Mn ‚â§ r) = Pr(R1 ‚â§ r, R2 ‚â§ r, . . . , Rn ‚â§ r)\\n\\n= Pr(R1 ‚â§ r) Pr(R2 ‚â§ r) ¬∑ ¬∑ ¬∑ Pr(Rn ‚â§ r) = [(F (p, q))(r)]n,\\n\\nif the repairs induce independent costs. Since (F (p, q))(r) ‚â§ 1 for all r by deÔ¨Ånition of\\na distribution function, we end up concluding that the long-run maximum is either zero\\nor one, as [(F (p, q))(r)]n ‚Üí 0 if (F (p, q))(r) < 1, or remains F (p, q)(r) = 1 otherwise.\\nSo the maximum is not as informative as we may hope under the assumptions made.\\nNevertheless, modeling maxima is indeed the proper way to control risk, and theorem\\n2.15 Ô¨Åts our (cid:22)-relation and framework quite well into these classical line of approaches.\\n\\n6 Outlook\\n\\nSo far, various practical issues have been left untouched, which will be covered in com-\\npanion work to this report. In particular, future discussions will include:\\n\\n‚Ä¢ Methods and models to capture extreme events (distributions commonly used in\\n\\nquantitative risk management)\\n\\n35\\n\\n\\x0c‚Ä¢ Methods and algorithms to compile payoÔ¨Ä distributions from simulation or empir-\\n\\nical data\\n\\n‚Ä¢ Algorithms to eÔ¨Éciently decide preference and equivalence among probability dis-\\n\\ntributions\\n\\n‚Ä¢ Algorithms to numerically compute security strategies that account for the limited\\narithmetic that we can do in lack of an explicit model of the hyperreal structure\\nthat represents our distributions.\\n\\nThis report is meant to provide the theoretical fundament to build the practical anal-\\nysis methods that are described in follow-up work. In that sequel to this research, issues\\nof modeling extreme events and damage distributions for a game-theoretic risk control\\nwill be discussed.\\n\\nAcknowledgment\\n\\nThis work was supported by the European Commission‚Äôs Project No. 608090, HyRiM\\n(Hybrid Risk Management for Utility Networks) under the 7th Framework Programme\\n(FP7-SEC-2013-1).
